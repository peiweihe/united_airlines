"1","United Puts Off CEO’s Added Role as Chairman Amid Dragging Furor","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-21/united-ceo-won-t-automatically-add-chairman-title-next-year","17198","United Airlines canceled Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz’s expected 2018 elevation to chairman and tied compensation more closely to customer service, after a passenger’s forcible removal from a flight sparked a public-relations disaster., Maintaining an independent chairman “is a means to ensure that Mr. Munoz is able to more exclusively focus on his role as chief executive officer,” United Continental Holdings Inc. said in a regulatory filing Friday. The carrier said it would link executive bonuses in part to “demonstrable progress toward improvements in the customer experience.”, The airline adopted the changes less than two weeks after passenger David Dao was dragged off a plane by security officers in Chicago. Dao suffered a concussion, broken nose and two lost teeth after he refused to give up his seat for a United crew member before the flight left for Louisville, Kentucky, his lawyer said., Munoz, who had been expected to add the chairman’s role at next year’s annual shareholders meeting, initiated the change, according to the filing. He already agreed last year to delay becoming chairman, after the board was revamped as part of a deal with two activist shareholders. The company named Robert Milton as chairman, and three incumbent directors decided not to stand for re-election., “The board also believes that an independent chairman of the board can effectively manage the relationship between the board and the chief executive officer,” the company said in the filing., United said bonus payouts would also be tied to “necessary cultural and process changes,” saying the adjustments were prompted by “recent events.” Until 2016, the airline used customer surveys as one tool in determining compensation. Last year it switched to a metric based on the rate of on-time arrivals., It’s too soon to say how the Chicago-based company will measure customer satisfaction in the future, said spokeswoman Megan McCarthy. , Munoz earned $18.7 million last year as he collected a multimillion-dollar signing award. The company granted him stock valued at $6.8 million to entice him to join the company in September 2015. The payout came well before the April 9 incident with Dao., Munoz said earlier this week that Dao’s treatment was a “humbling learning experience” for United and accepted full responsibility., The CEO’s initial reaction drew scorn worldwide last week when he called the incident “upsetting” and apologized for having to “re-accommodate” the passengers who were asked to leave the plane. Hours later he told employees that Dao had been “disruptive and belligerent,” based on early reports., He finally appeared on ABC’s “Good Morning America” with a more contrite message and promised a full review of United’s policies regarding oversold flights."

Munoz, who also announced a first-quarter financial performance that topped expectations, is trying to maintain momentum for his plan to catch up to Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. in profitability and operational performance., “United said the right things regarding its need to upgrade its customer service and should be able to move past its PR nightmare,” Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA Research, said in a note to clients in which he reiterated a “strong buy” rating on the shares., The shares were unchanged at $70.77 at 9:34 a.m. in New York. The company plans to hold a conference call at 10:30 a.m. to discuss the financial results., Munoz’s sober tone contrasted with a better-than-expected financial performance. Adjusted earnings of 41 cents a share beat the 38-cent average of analyst estimates even as higher fuel and labor costs caused profit to fall from a year earlier. Sales were $8.42 billion, topping the $8.38 billion that analysts anticipated., Passenger revenue for each seat flown a mile will rise by 1 percent to 3 percent in the current quarter, the Chicago-based airline said. That would be the first increase for the crucial benchmark since the first three months of 2015., “We are most interested with how each region is performing,” Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker wrote in a note to investors. “We suspect the underlying improvement is being driven by the domestic and Latin American markets. It will be interesting to see how the Pacific and Atlantic are performing, given both regions have been drags” on profit., Domestic capacity will climb by as much as 5.5 percent in the second quarter while total capacity will rise by a maximum of 4 percent, United said., Munoz said Dao’s treatment was a “humbling experience” for United and accepted full responsibility., The CEO’s initial reaction drew scorn worldwide last week when he called the incident “upsetting” and apologized for having to “re-accommodate” the passengers who were asked to leave the plane. Hours later he told employees that Dao had been “disruptive and belligerent” after being asked to leave the plane, based on early reports., He finally went on ABC’s “Good Morning America” with a more contrite message and promised a full review of United’s policies regarding oversold flights., Dao suffered a concussion, broken nose and two lost teeth, and “probably” will sue the carrier, his lawyer, Thomas Demetrio, said at a press conference last week."

That trims competition from the biggest Persian Gulf carrier -- a persistent irritant to long-haul U.S. operators that see it as an unfair rival., With fewer flights, some Emirates passengers may switch to big European airlines and their U.S. partners for travel from the Middle East and Asia. American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. have prodded U.S. officials for two years to act on their complaints that $50 billion in government support has enabled Emirates, Etihad Airways PJSC and Qatar Airways Ltd. to compete unfairly., “Any reduction in capacity from them is only a good thing for U.S. airlines,” said Joe DeNardi, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., Etihad said demand remained strong for flights to the U.S. and pledged to upgrade New York service by using Airbus SE A380 super jumbo jets. Qatar Airways, which also serves airports affected by the laptop ban, didn’t immediately comment on its own capacity in the U.S., “I understand the problem and I agree as a business traveler, that’s my most productive travel and now I’m looking to book through Europe,” said Michael Weiss, an Atlanta businessman who frequently travels to the Middle East and has preferred the customer service on Qatar Airways. “Fellow peers are doing the same thing because we need to be able to work.”, A Bloomberg index of U.S. airlines advanced 1.4 percent at the close in New York, the biggest gain in three weeks., American declined to comment. United and Delta referred questions to the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies, which represents the carriers and several airline unions. In a statement Wednesday, that group said the Persian Gulf carriers were “propped up by billions of dollars in government cash” and as a result have never considered market demand in deciding where to fly., Emirates’ service to Seattle, Boston and Los Angeles will drop to one a day from two, while Fort Lauderdale and Orlando will get five flights a week, compared with daily services now. The changes will be phased in starting on May 1, the airline said in a statement Wednesday., “The recent actions taken by the U.S. government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins, have had a direct impact on consumer interest and demand for air travel into the U.S.,” Emirates said. “Over the past three months, we have seen a significant deterioration in the booking profiles on all our U.S. routes, across all travel segments.”, Emirates will redeploy some U.S. capacity to serve routes across its global network. The carrier’s Dubai hub was one of the 10 airports affected by a ban on electronics in carry-on luggage on U.S.-bound flights. Trump’s order restricting visitors from six countries -- Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- has been blocked in court., Emirates, which serves 12 U.S. cities as part of its network of more than 150 destinations worldwide, will “closely monitor” the situation with the “view to reinstate and grow” its U.S. operations as soon as viable, it said., Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways have grabbed a substantial portion of the lucrative market for travel from the Americas and Europe to the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Australia by developing their home bases into huge transfer hubs. If travelers look to European carriers to get to the Middle East or India, U.S. carriers could benefit through revenue-sharing agreements with partner airlines., “If Emirates slashes their presence to Seattle in half, that’s a few hundred seats a week,” said Peter van der Lende, a former Delta executive who worked on global alliances. “That traffic would have gone to Dubai and beyond. Some of that traffic needs to find other solutions. The one that’s on top of the list to receive that traffic is Delta,” which has a Seattle hub., Some of the flights Emirates is cutting may not have been very profitable, van der Lende said. Florida cities often attract more leisure travelers than lucrative business fliers. Boston doesn’t work as well as other Emirates destinations such as Dallas for flight connections to other U.S. cities., “I think they were hurt by both bans, but most likely those routes were marginally profitable, if at all,” said van der Lende, who’s now a business development consultant in Atlanta with Expand360."

"10","United Picks a Funny Time to Attract More Passengers","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-19/united-picks-a-funny-time-to-attract-more-passengers","17175","Just as United Airlines Inc. grapples with the fallout from a customer service debacle, the carrier is embarking on a growth spurt—an effort to regain what its president dubs “natural market share” after years of decisions that ceded traffic to rivals., In the second quarter, United plans to boost domestic growth by as much as 5.5 percent as its mainline flights expand and regional jets disappear on marquee business routes such as Chicago-Washington and Newark-Atlanta. The switch to larger jets for many destinations is meant to show that United has a superior product while making it more competitive with domestic rivals. United also wants to command higher shares at its hubs, much the way its competitors do in cities such as Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Charlotte, N.C., and Detroit., “This is not trying to go invade someone’s hub. This is about restoring United to where it should have been,” President Scott Kirby told analysts Tuesday, seeking to assure them that turf battles and fare wars aren’t in the offing., The timing is a bit awkward, given the ferocious, global denunciations the airline faced last week over that incident in Chicago. The carrier called airport security to an O’Hare International Airport gate on April 9 when Dr. David Dao declined to relinquish his seat to an airline employee. Dao suffered a concussion, broken nose, and other injuries when security personnel dragged him from the plane. His lawyers have said he plans to sue., United executives said on Tuesday they have fielded “appropriate questions and concerns” from corporate customers and are reviewing the assault on the passenger, as well as new policies aimed at preventing a recurrence. Naturally, that review will revive news of the incident and bring fresh attention to it when United makes the report public later this month., The planned domestic growth at United, while modest relative to low-cost carriers, is rare in this era, in which four huge airlines have carved up most of the U.S. market. American Airlines Group Inc. plans systemwide, second-quarter growth of 1 percent, while Delta Air Lines Inc. plans growth of 1 percent or less, and possibly none. Domestically, Southwest Airlines Co. has targeted 2.5 percent growth for the full year., The United hub growth strategy, begun under Kirby, a former American Airlines president, is a marked reversal from United’s network approach following its 2010 merger with Continental. Under former Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smisek, the airline turned to regional flying and shrank domestically in response to weak financial returns relative to those of the industry., “United did a lot of cumulative actions in the past three or four years, which caused it to lose its natural share, and which hurt its financials,” Kirby said to the analysts, adding: “And you guys used to get on this earnings call and beat them up.” Wall Street’s proposed solution of cutting capacity just made things worse, he said., The new strategy is also driven by the tight supply of pilots in the regional jet industry. “Everyone knows that United never should have been flying regional jets in markets like Chicago to Washington National or New York to Atlanta,” Kirby said. He cited United’s 1,200 daily seats on six mainline flights between Atlanta and Newark, restored from the 300 it flew with 50-seat regional jets on the route for several years. Amid United’s prior downsizing, Delta retained its 1,800 daily seats on a dozen mainline flights between those cities, Kirby said, helping that airline boost the 60 percent market share it enjoyed as United’s 40 percent share slipped. United is now aiming to return to the “natural” level it previously enjoyed., Investors remain skeptical that United’s new flying will work in tandem with higher profits—shares in parent United Continental Holdings Inc. dropped 4 percent on Tuesday. Also unclear: Will the rest of the industry stand pat as United builds greater market share, even if it’s focused on the carrier’s own hubs?, “There is no 'natural share,' everything is market share,” said George Ferguson, an aerospace and defense analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “When you’re expanding, you’re trying to take market share. Delta is going to be ticked.” He said United is “talking right at business travel, and when you’re talking about business travel, there’s going to be a fight to keep it.”, Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker echoed that sentiment in a client note on Tuesday: “So far there hasn’t been a competitive response, but these are high-value business travelers we are speaking about. We do not believe this strategy will be ignored by the other airlines.”"

Japanese people endured an economic slump, stayed calm and ""the sense of pride among workers is still intact"" he said, adding ""Airline crew will not beat you,"" according to the text of the speech distributed to reporters at the event., Aso used the wide-ranging speech to extol the leadership of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as well as advocate the progress Japan has made in the labor participation rate for women and corporate governance. Japan’s high quality and affordable taxi services also got a mention, with Aso commenting that they makes businesses like Uber Technologies Inc. unnecessary., Aso, 76, who hosted Vice President Mike Pence in Tokyo this week for a bilateral economic dialogue, is in the U.S. for spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and talks with his G-20 counterparts., His comment on the airline crew was an apparent reference to an April 9 incident in which a passenger was forcibly removed from a United plane. The airline faced widespread criticism on social media and has apologized. The passenger was injured and his lawyer has indicated a lawsuit is likely., Read more: United won’t fire anyone over incident., Aso, himself a one-time premier who currently oversees the finance and banking ministries, has been known for blunt comments and the occasional verbal gaffe., Last year he called securities workers shady characters and he once asked why old people were worried about making ends meet given they won’t be around much longer, according to local media. On another occasion, Aso said the government could learn ways to change the constitution from the Nazis, a remark which caused a furor and was later retracted., Aso also used his speech at Columbia to highlight his concern about the toll Japan’s aging population has taken on public finances, which he said was some of the ""bad news"" for the outlook of an economy with one of the oldest populations., Here’s more on previous comments by Aso that have caused a stir., Aso said he disagrees with the notion that Japan has been through a period of ""lost decades."", He told the New York audience that Japan has undergone a ""revolution"" of sorts during recent decades, making gains with a female labor participation rate that eclipsed that of the U.S. in 2015. Companies have also made strides with their efforts to increase shareholder return policies, he said., On a personal note, Aso said he misses some of the Japan of old, but welcomes companies focusing their energies on corporate governance rather than wining and dining., ""It is no wonder that in Ginza, the posh night-life district, you now see fewer chauffeur driven cars, and more and more coaches filled with Chinese shoppers,"" Aso said. ""Do I miss the Ginza of days gone by? Of course I do."""

He was 82., He died April 18 at his home in Las Vegas, according to an email from his wife, Sue. The cause was heart disease., “My switch from henchman to gadfly incensed many CEOs, some of whom called me a Judas and asked where they should deliver the 30 pieces of silver,” Crystal wrote in a 1996 article for Slate.com. “In a sense, though, those CEOs and I were operating on the same wavelength. They were quoting from the Bible, while I was beginning to think seriously about the need to save my immortal soul.”, For more than four decades, Crystal made a good but quiet living advising clients such as American Express Co. and General Electric Co. But once a critic, he found himself in the middle of controversies such as the alleged excesses of the employment contract that he helped Walt Disney Co. negotiate with Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz., Ovitz was hired to be the No. 2 to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Crystal had switched from consultant to critic in 1989, but he agreed in 1995 as a personal favor to Eisner to help the Disney board draft Ovitz’s employment contract., In the Slate article, titled “Michael Ovitz Got Away with Murder -- And I Helped Him,” Crystal explained he had warned Eisner he would put his critic hat back on if the contract became an issue -- which its $140 million severance provision did in news stories and shareholder litigation that upheld it., Crystal’s wife found it “incomprehensible” that the Disney board had agreed to pay Ovitz that kind of money for failing as the company’s president., “I couldn’t have put it better,” Crystal wrote., Crystal, who was a Bloomberg News columnist on executive-pay for eight years starting in 2000, prepared yearly reports identifying the most overpaid top executives, based on models he developed that compared compensation with a company’s size and performance., “Bud Crystal was relentless confronting the opacity of executive compensation and he benefited all investors, especially Bloomberg users, by setting the standard for bringing transparency to publicly-traded companies,” said Matthew Winkler, Bloomberg News editor-in-chief emeritus., Over the decades, he had some favorite targets, such as Stephen Wolf, ex-CEO of United Airlines Inc., whose 1990 pay was more than $18 million while the company’s profit fell 70 percent. Wolf made 1,200 times what a starting United flight attendant did, “60 Minutes” reported in an 1991 interview with Crystal., Other targets included Steven Ross of Time Warner Inc. and Lee Iacocca of Chrysler Corp., whose employers paid them enormous sums while their companies were performing poorly, Crystal said., Crystal had fun with his critiques, issuing in 2004 a list of All-Star Pay Hogs to coincide with Major League Baseball’s All Star game. Leading his list of greed among then-active CEOs was Citigroup Inc.’s Sanford Weill, who he called the runner-up to Ross in the all-time pay-hog-of-the-world contest., On the basis of stock-option grants, he also included: Larry Ellison of Oracle Corp., who in 2001 exercised options with gains of $706 million; Eisner, who turned options into almost $1 billion of pay; and Barry Diller of IAC/InterActive Corp., who reaped gains of $151 million in 2003, while holding options with paper profits of $1.1 billion., He also named as the All Star team manager former New York Stock Exchange CEO Richard Grasso, who fought with New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer over whether his $139.5 million in compensation was excessive. In the late 1970s, Crystal was the NYSE’s compensation consultant., Crystal also spotlighted CEOs he considered underpaid. The compensation for Bank of America Corp.’s Brian Moynihan -- $13.1 million in 2013 -- was 30 percent below the “going rate” for a company of his bank’s size., “Shareholder return is the best determinant of pay because it’s the only gauge of success that’s external and can’t be manipulated by accounting tricks or shifts in performance targets,’’ Crystal said., Graef Slater Crystal was born April 30, 1934, in Oakland, California, the son of Louis and Esther Harris Crystal. At age 10, after the death of his parents, an aunt and his maternal grandparents enrolled him at San Rafael Military Academy in San Rafael, California., He received a bachelor of arts degree in psychology from the University of California at Berkeley in 1956, and a master’s degree in the same subject from Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1962., After college, he worked as a management trainee for Sears, Roebuck & Co. before becoming a wage and salary analyst for RCA Corp. and the director of compensation at General Dynamics Corp. In 1968 he became director of compensation for Pfizer International Inc. and then a senior associate at Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. and a vice president at Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby., Crystal focused on pay packages as an adjunct professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. He was the editor of the Crystal Report on Executive Compensation., He also wrote six books including “In Search of Excess: The Overcompensation of American Executives” (1991), “Questions and Answers on Executive Compensation: How to Get What You’re Worth” (1984) and “Executive Compensation: Money, Motivation and Imagination” (1978)., In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter and two sons from a previous marriage: Allison Taliercio, Matthew Crystal and David Crystal. He also had three stepchildren from another marriage: Chad Cunningham, Amy Breninger and Jamie Baker., Asked why he thought CEOs didn’t like people complaining about their pay packages, Crystal told Charlie Rose in an interview in 1992: “Some of the things I’m saying will result in having their pay slashed, which is roughly the equivalent of trying to take a piece of filet out of the jaws of a Doberman who hasn’t eaten for a week.’’"

He acknowledged “lots of conjecture” about his own fate at the nation’s third-largest carrier and said “the buck stops here.”, Munoz faced Wall Street for the first time since David Dao’s forcible removal on April 9, apologizing again for the airline’s handling of the incident. So far, corporate customers have been “supportive” of United during the public relations crisis, President Scott Kirby said on the call to discuss first-quarter earnings. It’s too soon to tell if the bad publicity hurt bookings, the carrier said., Munoz plans to travel to China in a couple of weeks on a previously scheduled business trip and will meet with officials there about their concerns over the incident, he said. The story spread rapidly on social media in the Asian nation, which is a critical market for Chicago-based United., After getting pilloried over the scandal, Munoz faced skepticism from Wall Street over his intention to boost growth in flights and seats. Analysts asked why the company wasn’t instead trying to boost profit margins, which fell in the first quarter and trail those of Delta Air Lines Inc., The shares fell 4.3 percent to $67.71 at 3:21 p.m. in New York after sliding as much as 4.5 percent, the biggest intraday drop in a month., The questions highlighted concern among United’s investors as the carrier plans to boost seating capacity by as much as 4 percent across its network this quarter, including a domestic increase of as much as 5.5 percent. Munoz told analysts that the expansion is needed to win back the company’s “natural share” of the market at big hub airports including in Newark, New Jersey., “Market share is not a conversation we have in this room or with our board,” Munoz said on the conference call. “It is all about margin.”, United spooked some investors and analysts in February when it announced it would add 47 round-trip flights in the U.S. starting this summer as it tried to boost connections at its major hubs. In recent years, United has been among the most conservative U.S. airlines in adding seating capacity, and it boosted capacity by only 1.4 percent last year., Shares fell about 8 percent in early March after analysts reviewing published flight schedules discovered that United wouldn’t offset the new flights with cuts elsewhere in its network., “What folks are worried about here is that we saw the capacity increase domestically in the past month, month and-a-half,” Barclays Plc analyst Brandon Oglenski told Kirby on Tuesday. “The concern here is that maybe we’re a little bit more focused on market share than margins.”, Kirby said United was able to trim its capacity in the past partly by using small regional jets to fly between major markets, such as Newark to Atlanta, instead of using them to fly mostly to small markets such as Rochester, Minnesota. That wound up causing frequent travelers to switch to United’s rivals, Kirby said., Part of United’s seating capacity increase this year will come from putting larger jets on those major routes, he said., “Early on, we felt really good about how well this is working,” Kirby said. “It’s logical. This is not trying to go invade someone’s hub. This is about restoring United to where it should have been.”"

The manhandling of a doctor dragged off an overbooked flight in Chicago-- and Munoz’s response, widely viewed as ham-handed -- doesn’t figure to help his cause., Each day, United collects about 8,000 customer surveys on items such as legroom and the quality of in-flight coffee. Fliers were already pretty disgruntled. In 2016, researcher J.D. Power rated United dead last of traditional North American carriers. Early returns are now even less promising., “United Airlines just sent me a customer survey about my flight yesterday,” Meredith Tucker deadpanned on Twitter after the overbooking episode. “Looking forward to sharing my thoughts.”, Of course, Munoz won’t be begging on street corners if he’s docked the half a million. The CEO has 2016 target compensation of about $14.3 million, according to his employment agreement. The actual amount for last year is expected to be disclosed by month’s end., In a filing, the company’s board said executive pay is “designed to further our objective of aligning the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders and customers.” United declined to comment., United shareholders have sent the stock price down 1.3 percent this week through Wednesday., Southwest Airlines Co. also ties part of CEO Gary Kelly’s bonus to a measure of customer loyalty. Delta Air Lines Inc. links a part of CEO Ed Bastian’s annual long-term stock award to customer service., QuickTake Can Airlines Really Do That? Bumping and the Law, At the airline officially known as United Continental Holdings Inc., the board mentions “customer satisfaction” in the pay filing no less than 20 times. The company didn’t specify exactly how that’s calculated, though the bonus is tied to improvement of the survey results., Presumably, dragging customers out of their seats won’t help. A Twitter wag named Joe Householder wrote, under the hashtag, #awkward: “Based on experience, the guy on the #united flight is getting his, ‘tell us about your trip,” email survey about now.”,  , Another Twitter commentator said he actually received one, which asked, “According to you, why do we consider ourselves the best airline to fly with?”, His answer: “beats me.”"
"29","Canada's WestJet Plans Ultra-Low-Cost Unit to Fight Upstarts","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-20/discounter-westjet-plans-ultra-low-cost-unit-to-fight-upstarts","NA","Canadian discounter WestJet Airlines Ltd. is arming itself for more fare wars by planning to start an ultra-low-cost carrier to fend off domestic upstarts., Service is expected to begin late this year with a fleet of 10 Boeing Co. 737-800s in “high density” configuration, Calgary-based WestJet said in a statement Thursday. The venture will aim to offer “no frills, lower-cost travel options,” Canada’s No. 2 carrier said., Founded in 1996 to cater to leisure travelers, WestJet has been moving away from its original no-frills model -- patterned after U.S.-based Southwest Airlines Co. -- by adding premium economy seats, rolling out a short-haul unit and starting overseas flights to European destinations such as London. Its fleet, meanwhile, has expanded from single-aisle 737s to include turboprops and double-aisle jets., “This makes a lot of sense,” said AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray. “This ULCC lets them use existing aircraft, fly to routes they already know, densify their network, plus it spreads their overhead costs better. It’s a lower-risk proposition than going to a wide-body strategy.”, Canada Jetlines Ltd. and Enerjet Ltd. have announced plans to begin operating ultra-low-cost carriers to challenge WestJet and larger rival Air Canada. Jim Scott, chief executive officer of Canada Jetlines, dismissed WestJet’s plan as “nothing more than an ‘airline within an airline’ that will not increase competition and it remains to be seen whether it will be able to achieve the full benefits of a ULCC.”, WestJet’s new carrier “significantly complicates the plans of other participants,” Murray wrote in a note Thursday. The new service will also protect WestJet from “market erosion in the highly sensitive fare category of travelers.”, The decision to move ahead with the new unit came after years of studying the market, Bob Cummings, WestJet’s executive vice president, said in a telephone interview., “The new entrants are a factor, but only one of five or six,” Cummings said. “We think the timing is right. Were the new entrants a tipping point? No.”, Cummings declined to provide details on fares, routes or seating configurations, saying they will be announced later “for competitive reasons.”, Canada is the only member of the Group of Seven industrialized nations that doesn’t have access to an ultra-low-cost carrier, Murray wrote. While the country probably would support an ultra-low-cost market of about 50 aircraft and 10 million passengers a year, “significant stimulation” through lower prices is “required to be effective in the space.”, With its Encore short-haul unit and widebody jets to Europe, WestJet “already has a lot of initiatives underway and we question whether there are enough human resources to also launch an all-new ULCC,” Cameron Doerksen, a National Bank Financial analyst, said in a note., WestJet is continuing to weigh whether to add widebody jets to its own fleet on a permanent basis, Cummings said. The carrier now flies some leased Boeing 767 aircraft that are more than 20 years old., “We’re evaluating widebodies as a line of business,” Cummings said. “That includes being able to come to terms with a manufacturer on an order, but we’re not there yet. Widebody certainly isn’t on the shelf.”"

The service will commence Sept. 28 with four weekly flights from London’s Gatwick airport and will be operated with Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner aircraft seating as many as 344 passengers., “Our transatlantic flights have shown the huge demand for affordable long-haul travel, so we are delighted to expand into new markets,” Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kos said in the statement. “Travel should be affordable for all.”, Norwegian is betting denser seating and the lower operating costs of the 787 will allow it to steal passengers from costlier rivals and stimulate demand among price-sensitive travelers. The carrier has one of the industry’s most ambitious growth plans with more than 200 aircraft on order as it seeks to transfer the successful low-cost airline model to long-haul services. Norwegian will also fly Boeing’s latest narrow-body jet, the 737 Max, on routes across the North Atlantic starting this summer., The new service between London and Singapore, a popular business route, puts Norwegian in head-to-head competition with IAG SA’s British Airways and Singapore Air -- the only two airlines currently offering non-stop flights between the cities. BA flies the route twice a day, and Singapore Air serves it four times daily. The carriers use larger Boeing 777 and Airbus A380 aircraft., Norwegian has so far connected London with destinations in the U.S. and the Caribbean, targeting mainly leisure travelers. Its only Asian destination so far is Bangkok, which it serves from Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen. The latest Singapore flight could be part of a broader expansion as the company canvases locations for potential bases around the world, including plans for an arm in Argentina., To serve Singapore, Norwegian will use its U.K. subsidiary, with planes and crews based at Gatwick airport. The unit can make use of traffic rights to destinations in Asia, Africa and South America, the company said."
"32","Global Entry Passengers Swept Up In Trump’s Travel Ban","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-21/trump-s-travel-ban-is-frozen-but-the-fallout-isn-t","17198","U.S. Customs and Border Protection revoked the enrollment of people in the Global Entry program and other U.S. “trusted traveler” categories as part of the Trump administration’s travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations., The ban triggered raucous protests across the country and was quickly enjoined by the courts. But some industry groups contend the damage to the U.S. travel industry continues., American citizens certified for Global Entry often learned of the issue only when they sought to travel, according to the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which says it received “dozens” of complaints and is seeking agency records about the revocations through the Freedom of Information Act., A CBP spokeswoman, Jennifer Gabris, said the agency restored some enrollees by early February after the administration clarified that lawful permanent residents weren’t included in the ban. Last month, federal judges also blocked a revised ban. The CBP did not respond to questions about how many people had been purged and restored to the “trusted traveler” programs., Several of the people who complained about being removed from the programs were U.S. citizens originally from countries not included in the bans: India, Lebanon, and Pakistan, said Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which is based in Washington. And some had their Global Entry status revoked before the bans were announced, he said., Ayoub said he was “fairly certain” the government had revoked the status of members based on their names and wasn’t sure that everyone enrolled in the programs had been restored., “The allegation that U.S. Customs and Border Protection cancelled Trusted Traveler memberships because the member had a ‘Muslim-sounding name’ is completely false,” the agency said. Ayoub’s group filed a lawsuit April 18 in federal court saying that the CBP did not respond to its request for the records., “A lot of these individuals that contacted us are professionals …. they travel often for work and seminars,” Ayoub said. “Nothing changed in their circumstances or in their life to warrant [CBP] to go back and change their eligibility. The only thing that’s changed is the administration and the way CBP does things. What we want to know is ‘Are you focusing on Arab and Muslim-sound names?’ That’s the issue here.”, In its statement, the CBP said it has since restored all affected members of the four entry programs. But on Friday, nine Democratic U.S. senators wrote to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly seeking information about how many people had been removed from Global Entry and the other programs, how many had been reinstated, and the criteria used for the revocations. The group, which includes U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, requested the information by May 14. Attorneys working for the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee are seeking similar information back to November, when the presidential election occurred.,  “Since President Trump took office, members of the Arab and Muslim community have justifiably felt under attack,” the senators wrote, arguing that stripping travelers of their Global Entry status due to religion or ethnicity “likely violates” the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection clause against religious discrimination., To enroll in Global Entry, applicants must pay $100 and provide their fingerprints and other information to the government and complete an interview with the CBP. For those who have their enrollment revoked, the agency refers people to an ombudsman for review., The fallout for U.S. “trusted travelers” from the first travel ban is the latest area in which the president’s immigration and travel policies have had unforeseen consequences on the travel and hospitality industries., “Our reputation around the world is not something we can take for granted,” said Jonathan Grella, executive vice president of public affairs at the U.S. Travel Association. “Our industry is caught in the crossfire as we’re seeking to solve this issue of terrorism.”, The four programs CBP operates to speed entry into the U.S. include Global Entry, for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and citizens of seven other nations; NEXUS, for travel between the U.S. and Canada; Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI), for travel between the U.S. and Mexico’s land borders; and Free and Secure Trade (FAST), for “low-risk” commercial shipments between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico. As of Feb. 1, Switzerland was added to Global Entry, bringing the total to nine participating countries., The CBP has several exceptions for eligibility, including criminal convictions, false statements on one’s application, and those who “cannot satisfy CBP of your low-risk status.”, In December 2015, candidate Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S.” until the government effectively grasps the security situation. “It’s common sense and we have to do it,” Trump said at a campaign appearance in South Carolina, citing “hatred” of Americans by Muslims. “We have no choice.”, Courts haven’t allowed Trump that choice thus far, but the decision Wednesday by Emirates Airlines to curb its U.S. flying is one sign the message is being heard abroad. The Dubai-based carrier is culling 25 weekly flights from five of its dozen U.S. destinations, citing weaker U.S. travel demand given “recent actions taken by the U.S. government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting, and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins.”, Homeland Security employees have also increased searches of travelers’ mobile phones and other electronic devices, and prohibited electronics in the cabins of aircraft flying to the U.S. from 10 airports, mainly in the Middle East. Both as a candidate and president, Trump has also focused intensely on Mexico, once calling the nation a source of “bad hombres” and proposing a massive border wall., Trump’s rhetoric and unpopularity abroad is likely to reduce international arrivals by 4.3 million this year, according to market strategy firm Tourism Economics LLC, with more than $18 billion in visitor spending lost by 2019., Christopher Thompson, president and CEO of Brand USA, the U.S. government’s travel-marketing unit, said the industry is currently “dealing with perception versus reality” in terms of what effect Trump is likely to have. A strong U.S. dollar will degrade travel to the U.S. more than any policies, he said., The administration’s rhetoric and policies have created anxiety abroad and are likely to make some travelers reconsider plans to visit the U.S., said Jeff Senior, vice president of marketing at California-based reports operator KSL Resorts and global chair of the Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association Intl., a hotel marketing group., “The very first thing out of anybody’s mouth is sort of a combination of angst and curiosity about how the U.S. is behaving right now,” Senior said. “Nobody wants to travel to a place they don’t feel welcome. There’s some soul-searching taking place. There’s some wonderful destinations around the world—the U.S. isn’t the only place you can visit.”"

Another option is to buy a carbon fiber plant from another company if the technology is too complex to be adapted at Birla plants, the person said., Carbon fiber is finding increasing traction among defense manufacturers and automobiles makers that seek strong, high-tensile, heat-resistant and light materials. The market for carbon fiber -- dubbed the ‘wonder material’ by The Guardian newspaper last month -- is estimated to more than double to about $4.7 billion by 2022 from $2.2 billion in 2015, according to an Allied Market Research report., “The main positive is that it’s a much lighter material versus competitors such as steel or aluminium -- but is just as strong,” said Johnson Imode, a London-based analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “This makes for energy and efficiency savings for customers.”, The group’s consideration is still at an exploratory stage and there’s no timeline for entering this business, the person said. The demand from the automobile sector is particularly high as designers aim to make cars both lighter, stronger and less polluting, according to this person. The group doesn’t comment on “speculative stories,” spokeswoman Pragnya Ram said in an email response., Carbon fiber is a thin long strand, far thinner than even a human hair, in which carbon atoms are bonded together in a crystal alignment that makes the fiber incredibly strong for its size. Thousands of these strands are entwined together to form a yarn, which can be then woven into a fabric or used as it is., The applications for the material range from aircraft and spacecrafts to racing cars, sailboat masts, wind turbines and even golf clubs. The market could grow as much as 10 percent annually, Imode estimates., Nearly half of the airframe of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is comprised of carbon fiber reinforced plastic and other composites, according to the airline manufacturer., Japan, U.S. and Europe are home to the bulk of the world’s carbon fiber manufacturers, making it one of the likely corporate hunting grounds for Birla to scout for a target. The biggest players include Toray Industries Inc., Hexcel Corporation, Mitsubishi Rayon Co., Teijin Ltd., SGL Group, Cytec Industries Inc., Nippon Graphite Fiber Corp. and Zoltek Companies, Inc., The conglomerate, if it takes the plunge, would be the first large Indian player in the carbon fiber market., Birla, 49, known for his penchant for dealmaking, has sealed two dozen mergers and acquisitions in the past two decades., He’s in the process of combining his mobile-phone unit Idea Cellular Ltd. with Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian business to form the nation’s largest wireless carrier. UltraTech Cement Ltd. had bought cement units from debt-laden Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. last year. This month he received a nod from shareholders to merge two listed group firms, Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd. and Grasim Industries Ltd., to create a behemoth with $9 billion in combined revenues."

That trims competition from the biggest Persian Gulf carrier -- a persistent irritant to long-haul U.S. operators that see it as an unfair rival., With fewer flights, some Emirates passengers may switch to big European airlines and their U.S. partners for travel from the Middle East and Asia. American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. have prodded U.S. officials for two years to act on their complaints that $50 billion in government support has enabled Emirates, Etihad Airways PJSC and Qatar Airways Ltd. to compete unfairly., “Any reduction in capacity from them is only a good thing for U.S. airlines,” said Joe DeNardi, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., Etihad said demand remained strong for flights to the U.S. and pledged to upgrade New York service by using Airbus SE A380 super jumbo jets. Qatar Airways, which also serves airports affected by the laptop ban, didn’t immediately comment on its own capacity in the U.S., “I understand the problem and I agree as a business traveler, that’s my most productive travel and now I’m looking to book through Europe,” said Michael Weiss, an Atlanta businessman who frequently travels to the Middle East and has preferred the customer service on Qatar Airways. “Fellow peers are doing the same thing because we need to be able to work.”, A Bloomberg index of U.S. airlines advanced 1.4 percent at the close in New York, the biggest gain in three weeks., American declined to comment. United and Delta referred questions to the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies, which represents the carriers and several airline unions. In a statement Wednesday, that group said the Persian Gulf carriers were “propped up by billions of dollars in government cash” and as a result have never considered market demand in deciding where to fly., Emirates’ service to Seattle, Boston and Los Angeles will drop to one a day from two, while Fort Lauderdale and Orlando will get five flights a week, compared with daily services now. The changes will be phased in starting on May 1, the airline said in a statement Wednesday., “The recent actions taken by the U.S. government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins, have had a direct impact on consumer interest and demand for air travel into the U.S.,” Emirates said. “Over the past three months, we have seen a significant deterioration in the booking profiles on all our U.S. routes, across all travel segments.”, Emirates will redeploy some U.S. capacity to serve routes across its global network. The carrier’s Dubai hub was one of the 10 airports affected by a ban on electronics in carry-on luggage on U.S.-bound flights. Trump’s order restricting visitors from six countries -- Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- has been blocked in court., Emirates, which serves 12 U.S. cities as part of its network of more than 150 destinations worldwide, will “closely monitor” the situation with the “view to reinstate and grow” its U.S. operations as soon as viable, it said., Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways have grabbed a substantial portion of the lucrative market for travel from the Americas and Europe to the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Australia by developing their home bases into huge transfer hubs. If travelers look to European carriers to get to the Middle East or India, U.S. carriers could benefit through revenue-sharing agreements with partner airlines., “If Emirates slashes their presence to Seattle in half, that’s a few hundred seats a week,” said Peter van der Lende, a former Delta executive who worked on global alliances. “That traffic would have gone to Dubai and beyond. Some of that traffic needs to find other solutions. The one that’s on top of the list to receive that traffic is Delta,” which has a Seattle hub., Some of the flights Emirates is cutting may not have been very profitable, van der Lende said. Florida cities often attract more leisure travelers than lucrative business fliers. Boston doesn’t work as well as other Emirates destinations such as Dallas for flight connections to other U.S. cities., “I think they were hurt by both bans, but most likely those routes were marginally profitable, if at all,” said van der Lende, who’s now a business development consultant in Atlanta with Expand360."

The post ends with the punchline: “Fly the friendly skies... this time for real.”, The world’s biggest long-haul airline has taken a swipe at U.S. rivals before, most notably in a 2015 ad campaign that showed Jennifer Aniston being offered peanuts and a hand towel by American-accented flight attendants, before waking to find herself cosseted in the flat-bed seat of an Emirates superjumbo., Royal Jordanian’s anti-United tweet shows a picture of a no-smoking sign on one of its aircraft along with the message: “We would like to remind you that drags on our flights are strictly prohibited by passengers -- and crew.”, Turkish Air re-tweeted a message from Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington commenting: “Instead of involuntarily removing a passenger, Turkish Air assists in involuntarily adding one.” That’s after a girl was born last Friday on the carrier’s flight between Guinea and Burkina Faso., Qatar Air accompanied its drag-and-drop pun with the blurb: ""We’re united in our goal to always accommodate our passengers, even with our app updates.”, United Continental Holdings Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group have accused Emirates, Etihad Airways PJSC and Qatar of competing unfairly in global markets with the help of more than $40 billion in illegal government subsidies, something the Gulf carriers deny., The U.S. operators recently urged President Donald Trump to curb flying rights for their rivals. Tensions have ratcheted up further with an attempted ban on citizens of six Muslim-majority countries entering America, together with a bar on passengers carrying large electronic devices aboard U.S.-bound flights from airports in the Middle East and North Africa, including the bases of Emirates, Turkish Air, Qatar Air and Royal Jordanian., United’s Munoz on Tuesday issued a second apology for Sunday’s incident in Chicago, in which the ejected passenger, David Dao, was left bloodied and dazed, saying that “no one should ever be mistreated this way,” and promising a review of his airline’s procedures to be completed by April 30., The CEO had earlier apologized only for having to re-accommodate customers, labeling Dao, who received hospital treatment, “disruptive” and “belligerent.”"

The union plans to ask members later this week for feedback on reactions and advise them on what steps to take in response, he said Wednesday., “They have to be fit for duty,” Tajer said in an interview. “If the uniform is making them not fit for duty, then something has to change.”, American distributed 1.5 million pieces to 70,000 employees in its first major uniform change in 30 years. The airline has declined to recall the clothing. , The Association of Professional Flight Attendants has said more than 3,000 of its members have filed complaints since receiving the uniforms. American sets the count among all employees at about 800, including four pilots., “Whatever they find in their survey, we’re happy to meet and discuss it with them,” said Ron Defeo, a spokesman for American Airlines Group Inc. “We’ve shown we’re willing to work and find solutions. We’d do the same with pilots.”, Twin Hill, a unit of Tailored Brands Inc., supplied the new uniforms and has worked with the airline and the flight attendants’ union on testing since employees began reporting reactions. So far, nothing has been found to cause the problems., Read more: The mystery of American’s ailing flight attendants, American offered employees several options to replace uniform pieces, including an alternate supplier for flight attendants and customer-service agents. Pilots have been given non-wool and cotton versions from Twin Hill, and the airline is working to secure another option, Defeo said. Employees also are being allowed to wear old uniforms., A couple of pilots became ill enough that they couldn’t fly, Tajer said, and others discovered they had symptoms only while wearing the uniforms. , “We don’t know what we’re going to find out,” he said. “It’s certainly not the same numbers as the flight attendants, but there is some real concern that there’s a bigger problem out there.”, A representative for Tailored Brands didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment., The pilot cases were reported Tuesday by the Chicago Business Journal."

Attorney Thomas Demetrio said that Dao will “probably” sue., A hearing scheduled Monday was canceled after United and the city of Chicago agreed to Dao’s request to preserve and protect evidence, Demetrio’s office said Saturday. A filing last week asked a judge to require the airline and city to preserve surveillance videos, crew lists and other information., United crews previously could be booked on flights until the time of departure. The change will allow employees to bump passengers, if necessary, in the gate area to avoid what happened on Dao’s flight: forcing passengers to leave their seats after they already boarded the airplane, said Maggie Schmerin, a United spokeswoman., “This ensures situations like Flight 3411 never happen again,” she said., Bumping passengers is permitted by the U.S. Department of Transportation as long as airlines provide some compensation -- typically a voucher for future purchase -- and a seat on a later flight. If there aren’t enough volunteers, airlines can pick passengers -- on United, those who paid more for a ticket or fly frequently are less likely to be selected., Can Airlines Really Do That? Bumping and the Law, United initially said that Dao’s flight, from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport to Louisville, Kentucky, was overbooked, and its staff picked passengers to be bumped. But the airline later said it needed to make room for its own employees to keep other flights on schedule., United is reacting to pressure from the public-relations fiasco that blew up after the video spread on social media. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz initially called Dao “disruptive” and “belligerent” and apologized only for the need to “re-accommodate” him, but later struck a more contrite tone in a nationally televised interview., Competing airlines are taking note of the controversy and making changes of their own. Delta Air Lines Inc. increased the payouts its airport agents can offer passengers on overbooked flights to $2,000 from $800, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg., While United is modifying its policy when it comes to booking its own crew, it didn’t say if the policy of overbooking flights will be changed. The company said it is conducting a full review, and it will announce the results by April 30."

With the clip reaching one million views, management fired the employees, sanitized the store and produced its own video with a formal apology from President Patrick Doyle., The company’s response was to show outrage and take action, said Davia Temin, head of the New York-based crisis-management firm Temin & Co. CEO David Brandon kept his job and now runs Toys “R” Us Inc. Doyle succeeded him., An engine-room fire crippled the Carnival Triumph cruise ship in 2013, leaving 3,100 guests adrift in the Gulf of Mexico without working plumbing. Sewage backed up into the passenger decks, earning the ship the nickname the “Poop Cruise.”, While employees scrambled to the bring the vessel home, Carnival Corp. CEO Micky Arison took in a game of his Miami Heat basketball team. Four months later, Arison gave up the top job. He remains chairman and is still the largest shareholder of the company his father founded., In 2007 TV news cameras caught images of rodents scurrying around a New York KFC-Taco Bell location. Parent Yum Brands Inc. closed the franchised restaurant, labeled it an isolated incident and blamed construction in the basement of the building., Still, sales at other stores fell 11 percent in the first quarter afterward and the company replaced its chief marketing officer., Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Travis Kalanick was forced to apologize and pledged to “grow up” after Bloomberg in February published video of him yelling at a driver in a dispute over the ride-sharing company’s fare policy, the latest in a horrendous three-month run of controversies., Kalanick has promised to hire a chief operating officer to keep him on course, while the company has vowed to outline diversity goals and publish the results of a sexual harassment investigation., On Valentine’s Day 2007, storms left 130,000 JetBlue Airways Corp. passengers stranded, with some travelers stuck on the tarmac for up to 10 hours. CEO David Neeleman apologized profusely but three months later he was out the door, replaced by a new executive described as more of an “operations guy.”, On Tuesday, his newest airline, Brazilian carrier Azul SA, raised $572 million in a U.S. initial public offering and closed up 7.2 percent in its first day of trading. Neeleman used the day’s ceremony at the New York Stock Exchange to defend the industry’s overbooking of flights, the practice United initially said led to the confrontation on its flight this week., United has had more than its share of customer service snafus, including a 2008 incident in which country singer Dave Carroll said the airline damaged his instrument. A song and video he produced about the incident, “United Breaks Guitars,” went viral and has had almost 17 million views., The company later apologized and sought permission to use the video for training. CEO Glenn Tilton remained with the carrier until its merger with Continental was completed in October 2010., Carroll today speaks on customer service. In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., he lamented United’s lack of remorse over the current incident., “I would have thought they’d make some advances, but seven years later now, the same sort of problem has emerged,” he said in the interview. “I think it has to do with a culture in the company.”, Representatives of Chicago-based United didn’t respond to a request for comment."
"39","Can Airlines Really Do That? Bumping and the Law: QuickTake Q&A","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-11/can-airlines-really-do-that-bumping-and-the-law-quicktake-q-a","17167","When United Airlines had police forcibly remove a paying customer from his plane seat, dragging him down the aisle, the social-media response was immediate and global. United said the man was ejected because it needed his seat for an employee who was required in Louisville for duty the following day. The incident raises a host of legal, regulatory and corporate-branding questions:, Yes. When you purchase an airline ticket you’re also entering into a detailed contract that specifies the many rights an airline has related to the trip. One of them allows the carrier to seize your seat in return for compensation and an alternate means of transport, usually on a later flight. Airlines also can determine that when their employees must be somewhere for duty -- a status that, yes, may place them ahead of paying customers -- a passenger’s seat can be taken. That’s because not positioning a crew member can lead to a future flight cancellation or delay. , That was the situation on April 9 in Chicago, when United needed to get its staff to Louisville. United also says the passenger who became a social media sensation had been “disruptive” and “belligerent.” U.S. law prohibits passengers from threatening or interfering with airline crews, a standard that has been aggressively enforced since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. To be sure, if you are violent, belligerent, intoxicated or aggressive toward a crew member or being disruptive or disorderly toward other passengers, it is a safe bet that you will be booted from the plane. And the police may be summoned. Thatcher Stone, a lawyer who has successfully sued airlines over bumping incidents, advises that passengers should always follow instructions of airline crew, no matter how strongly they may feel., The U.S. Department of Transportation permits airlines to ask passengers to give up a reservation voluntarily in exchange for some compensation and a seat on a later flight. That typically means a voucher for a future purchase. Airlines solicit volunteers and start their offers low, generally $150 or $200, gradually increasing the compensation to encourage enough travelers to offer a seat. (United had reportedly offered $800 on the flight to Kentucky.) If not enough volunteers come forward, airlines then go the involuntary route, which regulators call “involuntary denied boardings.” When choosing who gets the bump, airlines typically assess your value: How often do you fly, how much did you pay for the ticket, how many miles have you amassed in the loyalty program, is there a connection in your trip? Are you headed to Denver or Tahiti? How many more flights remain that day to the destination? Are there minors flying? And yes, this process can occur even after an airplane has been boarded. On April 10, the DOT said it would review the denied boarding procedures followed on the United flight., First, such passengers are entitled to a “written statement describing their rights.” Stone said in lawsuits he’s brought against airlines, they most often didn’t bother to give passengers this statement. The compensation an airline must pay increases with the length of time a passenger is delayed reaching his or her destination. If the carrier can get you to the destination within an hour of the scheduled arrival, there’s no compensation. If it takes longer than two hours (or four hours on an international flight), then the airline must pay four times the airfare or as much as $1,350. You may also be able to score some meal vouchers or access to an airline’s lounge, depending on the situation. These are cases where being polite generally wins out over threats or shouting., Overselling is an airline’s response to a routine occurrence: People don’t always appear for a flight they’ve purchased. Selling more tickets than a plane’s seat count is a method to address that situation. In a consent order last summer, the Transportation Department explained its view of oversales as a way for airlines “to fill seats that would otherwise have gone empty due to ‘no shows,’ thereby achieving operational efficiencies including revenue enhancement for carriers, and resulting in benefits for passengers as a whole by enabling carriers to offer them lower fares.”, Not too much. Of about 660 million passengers last year who boarded the 12 largest U.S. airlines, about 475,000 gave up their seats or were bumped. The majority of those were volunteers -- only 40,600 had to relinquish their seats unwillingly. Because airlines have amassed years of traffic data, down to days, times, seasons and specific routes, they rarely need to give large vouchers to customers. The data also help them know how to tweak their oversales for each flight, which has helped drive involuntary denied boardings to extreme lows: Out of 131 million passengers last year, American Airlines Group Inc. bumped only 8,312 involuntarily, according to federal statistics. As a result of their data, airlines’ need to bump has decreased over the past decade and is likely to dip further over time., United suffered a pummeling on social media immediately after the incident. One tweet joked that the airline had set aside a new seating area known as “fight club.” Late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel lampooned the carrier on his show. Its stock dropped as much as 4.4 percent on Tuesday, then recovered almost half of that to $69.85 at 2:55 p.m. The longer term impact on the company isn’t clear., Yes, all airlines occasionally need to swipe a seat from a paying customer. But not all airlines oversell their flights as a way to combat no-shows. JetBlue Airways Corp. never has, following the belief of its founders that every passenger should be guaranteed a seat. In its brief history, Virgin America also eschewed overselling. Its new owner, Alaska Air Group Inc., does oversell so the same practice could extend to the merged company."

Sure, everyone knows that—but did you know how tight that grip is and what it means for you as a customer?A lot of people are thinking about that after Sunday’s violent treatment of a United Airlines passenger by Chicago airport security workers. Why would a business ever think it was OK to allow a paying customer to be assaulted so its own employee could take his seat?, Part of the reason may be that you, as a customer, don’t really have a practical alternative to punish the offending company. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United now have 85 percent of the market, compared with 55 percent in 2007

        . Like all monopolies, they have less pressure to improve customer service or fret about losing passengers. They’re certain you’ll be back. And it’s not just airlines: As of 2015, market concentration hit a three-decade high., When David Dao was left bloodied with a broken nose and missing teeth after being dragged down the plane’s aisle, it was met with a public outcry for accountability and better service—and even a boycott. But the reality of America’s economy, where monopolies are part of the commercial fabric, makes that threat less than effective., “If you are in Houston, good luck if you want to boycott United,” said John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University, referring to how the airline dominates that hub. “That’s called monopoly power, where you have little functional choice for your travel options.” He added: “If you look at a lot of the routes these firms dominate ... sure enough, the prices have risen.”, Major airline mergers picked up steam after the 2005 union of US Airways and America West Airlines. Next up was the 2008 merger of Delta and Northwest Airlines. Then came the 2010 Continental Airlines and United union, and Southwest and AirTran the year after that. The last major tie-ups were between US Airways and American Airlines in 2013 and, most recently, Alaska Air Group Inc.’s purchase of Virgin America., To be fair, one must remember the environment from which the modern airline monopoly sprung. Seth Kaplan, a managing partner at industry journal Airline Weekly, says consolidation wasn’t triggered by a desire for unwarranted profit, but rather by simple survival., “The industry was in crisis first because of 9/11. It was both a cost and revenue shock to the industry—suddenly all these new security costs,” Kaplan said. “At the same time, costs [were] going up partly because nobody wanted to fly, and later because [of] too much security hassle.” Additionally, carriers faced spiking fuel prices in the summer of 2008, a global economic downturn, and increased competition from upstarts led by JetBlue Airways Corp. and Spirit Airlines Inc., The majors eventually survived—and flourished. For passengers, however, things started going south. The period of mergers coincided with cuts to services. More baggage charges, fewer free meals and flight attendants. Plus, cuts to regional air travel. , “A decade ago anything that wasn’t a mandatory cost they were slashing,” Kaplan said. “The saying goes, ‘burning furniture to warm the house.’” Having fewer competing airlines has eased the pressure to reverse those cuts even though profits are now greater. And that’s unlikely to change. The airlines, meanwhile, contend that a profitable industry created by consolidation provides for a more stable U.S. air travel system and secure employment. As for overbooking, that original reason United gave for the Chicago incident (before conceding Dao was booted in favor of United employees), that’s been going on for a long time—and United isn’t even the worst offender. Purposeful overbooking is a financial tool carriers use to fill every seat possible., Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that the Department of Justice was unlikely to bring antitrust action against the major airline carriers. The government started the investigation into price fixing and collusion among airlines in 2015., Matt Stoller, a fellow at the open markets program at New America, said when the probe was announced that he didn’t expect anything to come of it. The Justice Department hasn’t really taken antitrust or mergers seriously for decades, he said., Indeed, the Justice Department investigated just three in 2015, compared with 22 cases in 1994., Kwoka and Stoller were among the speakers at a conference last week titled, “Is There a Concentration Problem in America?” hosted by the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center at the Booth School of Business. Attendees discussed how megacompanies are expanding, and not just in the airline industry. But the few carriers that fill up most American airports is certainly the most visible example., “This is not the airline industry an economist interested in competition or a passenger interested in options would want,” Kwoka said. “This is not where we should have ended up.”—With assistance from Matt Turner in New York, Michael Sasso in Atlanta, and Justin Bachman in Dallas."

Video posted to social media showed David Dao being pulled from his seat and dragged down the aisle after refusing to give up his spot., “For a long time, airlines, United in particular, have bullied us,” Demetrio said in a press conference in Chicago, where the incident took place. “Rudeness, bullying of customers, has gone the next step now, to physical injury.”, News of Dao’s injuries increased pressure on United, which is still contending with the fallout from a public-relations fiasco that erupted when the video went viral. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz initially called Dao “disruptive” and “belligerent” and apologized only for the need to “re-accommodate” him. Munoz later struck a more contrite tone in nationally televised interview., On Thursday, he spoke to several hundred United employees near Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, according to two people who attended. Workers rose to give him an ovation when Munoz said he didn’t intend to leave the company, after an employee expressed concern he might have to resign, the two said., Dao, 69, hasn’t yet sued, and because he essentially resisted arrest, he may not have a legal claim, according to Kevin Hopkins, a professor at John Marshall Law School in Chicago. But he’ll probably get a ""decent settlement” because of the media attention surrounding his removal from the plane and his press conference., “In the court of public opinion, he’s going to win,” Hopkins said., While it was right for Munoz to apologize on national television for the incident, Demetrio called the United boss’s apology “staged” at the urging of public relations advisers., Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United, declined to respond to that characterization. Munoz and the company called Dao “on numerous occasions” to apologize, contradicting an assertion by Demetrio that they hadn’t, according to a statement from the airline following the press conference., The Chicago-based company also reiterated that it is taking steps to prevent future incidents, including committing to only asking law enforcement to remove passengers in matters of safety and security., “This horrible situation has provided a harsh learning experience from which we will take immediate, concrete action,” United said in the statement. “We have committed to our customers and our employees that we are going to fix what’s broken so this never happens again.”, The shares fell 1.2 percent to $69.07 at the close in New York, capping a 2.6 percent slide this week., Dao, who was discharged from the hospital April 12, also suffered injury to his sinuses and will need reconstructive surgery, Demetrio said. Dao, a doctor, had to return to Louisville to see patients, Demetrio said. His wife, who is also a doctor and was on the flight, also had patients to see, the lawyer said. They were returning home from a vacation in California., Crystal Pepper, Dao’s daughter, said the whole family was “shocked and sickened to learn what had happened to him.”, Dao, who came to the U.S. from Vietnam in 1975 during the fall of Saigon, said being dragged down the airplane aisle -- on an April 9 flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky -- was “more horrifying” than what he experienced leaving Vietnam, Demetrio said., The city of Chicago, for whom the officers worked, is also responsible, Demetrio said. “Were these three officers, these storm troopers, doing the right thing? No,” he said., By casting Dao as a representative for other aggrieved passengers, his lawyer may have put additional pressure on United to improve its treatment of customers, said Todd Henderson, a law professor at the University of Chicago who teaches torts and corporate law., “Because everybody is rightfully outraged by what happened and because of the probability of this happening in the future, you can start to see the public benefit from this guy,” Henderson said."

Funny how quickly the blowback died when company apologized and pulled it. The United Airlines story, on the other hand, won’t go away, thanks in no small part to the company’s bungled response. First, a widely mocked statement that sounded like it was written by lawyers, using words like “re-accommodate.” Then, United blamed the customer, or in this case, the passenger, saying he was “disruptive” and “belligerent.” Kara Alaimo, who teaches public relations at Hofstra University, wrote for Bloomberg View that this was the statement that should have been issued immediately:, Video of the incident was tweeted midday on Sunday, but it wasn’t until Tuesday that United released a statement from Chief Executive Oscar Munoz saying that he would “deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard.”, 2) It’s Time to Worry About the U.S. Supreme Court AgainAfter weeks of drama over the U.S. Supreme Court, time to focus on law for a bit. Right? Nope. Justice Neil Gorsuch has just been sworn in, but already people are talking about the battle over the next vacant seat on the nation’s highest court. Rumors are swirling about the tenure of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Reagan appointee whose vote often decides politically charged cases.  He is planning to hold a reunion of his law clerks in June. That’s notable because he usually holds one every five years, but this gathering is coming a year ahead of that timetable. Kennedy hasn’t tipped his hand, and a spokeswoman said the reunion in late June, rather than mid-June before the court's term is over, just worked best with his schedule. , 3) Bragging About Being a Genius Can Cost You Millions in Divorce Court, He built a $225 million fortune in finance, working for private equity. But a U.K. panel of judges said Randy Work didn’t deserve anything more than the traditional 50-50 split of assets in the divorce battle with his wife of 20 years, Mandy Gray. Work said that he deserved 61 percent of the pie because he made millions using “groundbreaking methodologies” in debt markets. The argument that one party in a marriage made a “special contribution” to the couple’s wealth has only worked a handful of times in U.K. court, including in the 2005 divorce of WPP CEO Martin Sorrell, who won 60 percent of £75 million ($94 million). In fact, the court said Work’s genius argument was “unhelpful” to his case., 4) Wall Street Has Completely Bought Into the Electric Car, Tesla Inc. became the most valuable car company in America this week, passing General Motors Co. The company’s market cap rose to nearly $60 billion, just topping that of GM (it has since slid back). It’s a remarkable run for a company that has delivered fewer than 200,000 cars, in a nation that buys more than 17 million a year. Bloomberg’s David Welch writes that the rise shows how much investors have “bought into Musk’s vision that electric vehicles will eventually rule the road.” But is the company worth it? GM is expected to earn $9 billion this year. Ford’s number may top $6 billion. Tesla? It’s expected to lose almost $1 billion. , 5) Taxes in the U.S. Are Nowhere Near the Highest in the WorldJust in time for the annual IRS tax deadline comes a new analysis showing that the U.S. is nowhere near the top of a list of countries when it comes to income taxes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said a slew of European countries carve off a higher percentage of residents’ income, although the analysis didn’t include other types of taxes, such as property or sales taxes. Belgium took the biggest chunk—54 percent of the salary of a non-married worker. In the U.S., it’s 32 percent."

Managers can offer as much as $9,950, more than seven times the previous cap of $1,350, the memo dated April 13 says., The new policies come in the wake of a controversy that enveloped rival United this week, after law enforcement officers dragged a passenger off a United Express flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky. The passenger, David Dao, was already seated on the plane and refused to give up his seat to make room for a United crew member who needed to fly. The incident made worldwide news and led to questions about why the airline didn’t simply offer Dao more money to leave the plane., Delta spokesman Anthony Black confirmed the authenticity of the memo, but declined to comment further. United earlier this week said it would review its policies regarding overbooked flights and announce results of the review by April 30. The company reiterated its plan Friday after the contents of the Delta memo were reported., The memo also gives customer service agents tips on how to best deal with oversold flights, including looking for passengers with other options for non-stop flights. Agents are advised to contact managers if compensation above $2,000 is needed, the memo says. It does not address the United controversy., The airline is changing policy as it deals with its own bad publicity. An April 5 storm in Atlanta shut down Delta’s operations during heavy spring break travel, with delays made worse by a breakdown in the airline’s crew location and assignment systems, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in an email to customers. About 4,000 flights were canceled in the wake of the storm., Delta is offering hundreds of thousands of customers $200 flight vouchers or 20,000 bonus frequent-flier miles as part of an apology for flight cancellations earlier this month., “I have heard from many of you who feel like we let you down. In acknowledgment of what you endured, 20,000 bonus miles will be added to your SkyMiles account in the next 48 hours,” Bastian said in the emails, which were seen by Bloomberg. “I am sorry for what you experienced.”, The aftereffects of Delta’s storm-related disruptions lasted as many as six days for some travelers, as they struggled to rebook flights or shelved getaways while the airline attempted to recover from the breakdown. Delta said this week that the cancellations, lost revenue and other costs including travel vouchers and bonus mile giveaways will reduce second-quarter pretax profit by $125 million., Some Delta customers who are not SkyMiles members are getting emails offering $200 flight vouchers., As the second-largest U.S. airline, Delta runs about 6,000 flights a day during peak summer months. The airline has more than 800 planes and flies about 180 million passengers a year. , Delta has suffered a series of setbacks in the past year. In January, customers were marooned at airports when flights were grounded due to a computer system breakdown. In August, Delta canceled about 2,000 flights over a three-day period after its worldwide computer system failed., Delta’s Black declined to comment on the voucher and SkyMiles bonus gesture., “As always, any customer who feels the specifics of their flight requires additional attention should contact Delta Customer Care,” he said."

And no matter how dire the state of air travel seems—whether it's the disturbing video caught on a United Airlines flight or Delta's long delays last week—you, the passenger, are privy to only one side of the story., So when Norwegian offered me the opportunity to become a flight attendant last month, I decided to find out what it’s really like to fly the not-so-friendly skies. Here’s everything I learned while serving as a crew member aboard their 787-8 Dreamliner long-haul service from London (LGW) to New York (JFK).*, This may seem obvious given the recent airline news, but yes, flight attendants get free travel perks. And sometimes crew members are paid to fly on repositioning flights that get them to their next shift. They’re called “deadheads,” and they’re the most important passengers in terms of getting a seat on the plane, which is what led to the doctor in Chicago being forcibly removed from his United seat to accommodate one.,  , “Deadheads” is just the beginning. Did you know flight attendants play ping-pong on every flight? That’s what they call beverage service, thanks to the paddle-shaped trays they extend to fill your cup with coffee and tea (to avoid spillage of hot fluids). They also sleep in “crashpads”—shared apartments—when they’re off duty, which are often in “Crew Gardens” (that’s Kew Gardens—a neighborhood near NYC’s JFK airport—to most people). And live out of “Berthas,” or company-issued suitcases., What they surprisingly don’t have a code name for: belligerent customers. But they will refer to problem passengers in “aviation alphabet,” i.e. “21 Golf” for the person sitting in 21G.,  , Flight attendants and pilots never get stuck with the same food you’re eating. They get a completely different set of menu items from the passengers, reducing the risk of food poisoning across the entire airplane. But don’t be jealous. My fellow crew members ate cold platters of sandwiches and chocolate bars. And the customers got surprisingly well-prepared dishes, made in real ovens rather than in microwaves.,  , According to Ilse, another Norwegian crew member, “We all agree that Scandinavians are the best passengers you could ever ask for: So content with being on board, and they don’t ask for much. Passengers traveling from the U.K. and U.S., however, are much more demanding, constantly ringing the bell. They tend to cause a scene and love threatening to sue.” ,  , It’s considered a federal offense to open and imbibe your own liquor on a plane, as the captains on Norwegian will tell you at the start of any flight. So put away the duty-free booze—or anything that’s not served by a crew member: Individual consumption can easily lead to handcuffs when you disembark. (And the crew will be onto you if you order nothing but a glass of ice.), Don’t overdo it with the bar cart nips, either. Flight attendants keep careful tabs on how many drinks each passenger requests, and they reserve the right to refuse you service if you appear too intoxicated. One or two drinks at mealtime is considered standard—but if you’re slurring words, looking glassy-eyed, or making constant trips to the bathroom, the crew is likely watching.,  , After years of flying both in the front and back of the plane, I assumed that working in the premium cabins was a more coveted role: You’re in charge of fewer, more comfortable passengers. I was wrong. Billie Jean and Derek, two of my crew mates, explained that on Dreamliners, most flight attendants prefer the economy service. “Premium passengers aren’t any more or less demanding than economy passengers,"" said Billie Jean, ""and it can be boring manning the galley away from the rest of the crew.”,  , Businessmen, babies, or blissed-out yogis: Which is most likely to annoy a flight attendant? Crew members agree: Yogis take the prize. “It happens at least once a flight, they come into our galley space and start doing stretches, or—even worse—push-ups,” said Ilse. Fellow crew member Grace and Derek agreed and said flights to and from the West Coast carried the greatest number of offenders by far.,  , Yes, it’s true: On transcontinental flights, flight attendants can take naps in a secret dorm room above the galley, through a door that looks like an inconspicuous closet near the lavatories. The berths are like plastic nests with full length-beds, sheets, pillows, and privacy curtains. And breaks are carefully timed: My team was divided into two groups, each getting one hour and 40 minutes of rest in the dorm. To avoid tardiness and miscommunication, the entire cabin crew syncs their analog watches—a wardrobe must—to the time of their destination.,  , Airplane bathrooms are not for the faint of heart. Their stench has even been known to ground long-haul flights., Norwegian’s policy is to clean the lavatories every 20 minutes—and yes, that’s the responsibility of flight attendants. Fun fact: Attendants regularly cover up strong odors by brewing a large pot of coffee and pouring it down the toilet. It neutralizes both the bacteria and the smell.   ,  , “It actually happens far more frequently than you think. I’d say at least once a month someone tries it, with about a 30 percent success rate,” Ilse explained. “We’ve even seen total strangers meet on a flight and make a run for the lavatory together.”, That’s about once every eight flights, if you do the math. As for the failed encounters? Suffice it to say that sprints to the lavatories are usually intercepted. “Sometimes I just want to give the passengers a ton of Purel and say, ‘what are you thinking?’” joked Grace. ,  , Contrary to popular belief, the cabin crew does indeed possess the ability to move you into premium seats. But there probably isn’t space for you., If the front cabin isn’t sold out, initial upgrades go to airline employees first, then family and friends of the staff. , Getting other types of freebies is easier: Just bring a fun snack on board to share with the crew. Think bags of candy. According to my colleagues, edible gifts are considered a kind of inter-airline currency and can be rewarded with free cocktails or other in-flight goodies. (Every flight team has the ability to override the computerized purchasing system.), But if it’s that elusive free upgrade you’re after, you’re just going to have to become a flight attendant yourself. And now that you’ve peeked behind the galley curtain, you’re almost ready to fly. ,  "

But the fiasco is hardly the first self-inflicted corporate blunder. Munoz can take comfort that it’s happened to others, and in many cases the bosses didn’t lose their jobs, as our PR Tales From Hell illustrate., QuickTake Can Airlines Really Do That? Bumping and the Law, Over Easter week in 2009, two Domino’s Pizza employees in North Carolina posted a video on YouTube showing one sticking cheese up his nose and pretending to sneeze on a customer’s sandwich. With the clip reaching one million views, management fired the employees, sanitized the store and produced its own video with a formal apology from President Patrick Doyle., The company’s response was to show outrage and take action, said Davia Temin, head of the New York-based crisis-management firm Temin & Co. CEO David Brandon kept his job and now runs Toys “R” Us Inc. Doyle succeeded him., An engine-room fire crippled the Carnival Triumph cruise ship in 2013, leaving 3,100 guests adrift in the Gulf of Mexico without working plumbing. Sewage backed up into the passenger decks, earning the ship the nickname the “Poop Cruise.”, While employees scrambled to the bring the vessel home, Carnival Corp. CEO Micky Arison took in a game of his Miami Heat basketball team. Four months later, Arison gave up the top job. He remains chairman and is still the largest shareholder of the company his father founded., In 2007 TV news cameras caught images of rodents scurrying around a New York KFC-Taco Bell location. Parent Yum Brands Inc. closed the franchised restaurant, labeled it an isolated incident and blamed construction in the basement of the building., Still, sales at other stores fell 11 percent in the first quarter afterward and the company replaced its chief marketing officer., Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Travis Kalanick was forced to apologize and pledged to “grow up” after Bloomberg in February published video of him yelling at a driver in a dispute over the ride-sharing company’s fare policy, the latest in a horrendous three-month run of controversies., Kalanick has promised to hire a chief operating officer to keep him on course, while the company has vowed to outline diversity goals and publish the results of a sexual harassment investigation., On Valentine’s Day 2007, storms left 130,000 JetBlue Airways Corp. passengers stranded, with some travelers stuck on the tarmac for up to 10 hours. CEO David Neeleman apologized profusely but three months later he was out the door, replaced by a new executive described as more of an “operations guy.”, On Tuesday, his newest airline, Brazilian carrier Azul SA, raised $572 million in a U.S. initial public offering and closed up 7.2 percent in its first day of trading. Neeleman used the day’s ceremony at the New York Stock Exchange to defend the industry’s overbooking of flights, the practice United initially said led to the confrontation on its flight this week., United has had more than its share of customer service snafus, including a 2008 incident in which country singer Dave Carroll said the airline damaged his instrument. A song and video he produced about the incident, “United Breaks Guitars,” went viral and has had almost 17 million views., The company later apologized and sought permission to use the video for training. CEO Glenn Tilton remained with the carrier until its merger with Continental was completed in October 2010., Carroll today speaks on customer service. In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., he lamented United’s lack of remorse over the current incident., “I would have thought they’d make some advances, but seven years later now, the same sort of problem has emerged,” he said in the interview. “I think it has to do with a culture in the company.”, Representatives of Chicago-based United didn’t respond to a request for comment."

But these sentiments are at odds with the reality of consumer behavior: Only 45 percent of consumers purchase from companies they consider ethical, Mintel found. , ""People like to think they would make the right decision, but there are other factors,"" said Fiona O'Donnell, Mintel's director of travel and leisure reports. ""It's not just black and white."", Cost and convenience matter most to consumers, especially when it comes to air travel. Asked what would inspire them to pick one airline over another in a March 2016 Mintel study, the majority cited price, followed by scheduling. Only 37 percent cited customer service. An even slimmer margin, 25 percent, said their primary reason for picking a carrier was to avoid a different airline., Air travel is already a widely loathed industry. Passengers are regularly subjected to shrinking seats and growing fees. Most flyers equate picking a specific carrier with choosing a specific poison. , Consumers also tend to have short memories. ""People will hold out and stay away from companies that have personally done them wrong,"" O'Donnell said. ""But someone who travels once or twice a year, who saw the video on YouTube?"" They may shrug off the incident to save a few bucks., Despite the research, United has reasons to be concerned about its bottom line if lucrative, high-volume business customers are put off by the video. O'Donnell noted that the scandal was causing an uproar in the Asian community, as the passenger was of Asian descent. ""I think they need to make some apologies,"" she said. , In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz did just that and vowed to review the incident. ""I want you to know that we take full responsibility and we will work to make it right,"" he said.

A production disruption at one of Libya’s oil fields and expectations for a busy summer driving season helped buoy prices, pushing the front-month contract as much as 1.7 percent higher on the day to more than $53 per barrel., Rising oil prices weren’t the only bad news for airlines. A United Airlines passenger was violently removed from a flight by police as the airline sought to make more room for its employees. Video of the incident sparked outrage on social media. Meanwhile, last week’s storm in Atlanta has caused Delta Air Lines to cancel roughly 3,500 flights since Wednesday. In the end, investors showed more concern for Delta’s delays than United’s fracas; the latter fell 0.5 percent while the former rose 0.9 percent in trading in New York Monday., Fed Chair Janet Yellen took questions from the audience and via Twitter at the University of Michigan on Monday. She emphasized that the U.S. economy no longer needs a large amount of monetary stimulus, justifying the central bank’s move to a more neutral stance. The Chair added that inflation was “slightly below” the Fed’s objective, but that the unemployment rate was also below levels some monetary policymakers believe is consistent with full employment. Yellen’s remarks didn’t have a major impact on the market., U.S. Treasuries gained on Monday as investors mulled rising geopolitical tensions in Asia and the Middle East.

A recording of the incident posted on social media sent people across the globe into an apoplectic rage over the carrier’s heavy-handed response., Swift social media condemnation—and from Washington as well—landed heavily on United. The passenger wasn’t ejected for misbehavior or even presenting a security threat. It was because United said the flight was overbooked. Without volunteers, the airline staff had chosen passengers, including the man, to be bumped. (Later, United said it actually needed the seats for its own employees, not other paying customers)., The man dragged down the aisle of Flight 3411 that night was reportedly a doctor who said he had to be in Louisville for work the next day, according to a Twitter account by a passenger who said he was on board the aircraft., “After our team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate,” United said Sunday night. “We apologize for the overbook situation.” The flight from Chicago O’Hare International Airport arrived at 10:01 p.m., almost two hours late “due to operational difficulties,” according to United’s website., On Monday, United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz apologized for “having to re-accommodate these customers.” In an emailed statement, he said the airline is conducting a review and seeks to resolve the matter with the man who was dragged off the airplane. Munoz’s response, however, didn’t satisfy Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, who called the incident “disturbing” and Munoz’s statement an “empty apology.” Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, a non-voting House Democrat, called for Congressional hearings.,  , But in a subsequent internal message sent to United employees this evening, a copy of which the airline provided Bloomberg News, Munoz was less contrite. He alleged that the passenger became “disruptive” and “belligerent” after being repeatedly asked to leave the plane, and that the man later attempted to run back on to the aircraft after being forcibly removed., Munoz said that “the facts and circumstances are still evolving, especially with respect to why this customer defied Chicago Aviation Security Officers the way he did.”, Chicago Department of Aviation, meanwhile, suspended one of the officers involved. In a statement, it said “the incident on United flight 3411 was not in accordance with our standard operating procedure and the actions of the aviation security officer are obviously not condoned by the Department. That officer has been placed on leave effective today pending a thorough review of the situation.”The incident demonstrates how airline bumping can veer into confrontation. Carriers around the world routinely oversell their flights because it’s a rational response to a mundane situation that occurs daily: People don’t always appear for a flight they’ve purchased. Overselling is a way to cover that situation while maximizing the airline’s revenue., United should have increased the compensation offered to passengers to entice volunteers, CFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore wrote in a client note Monday. “We think this situation was handled in a deplorable fashion, but note that United has the right to refuse boarding to any passenger for any reason,” he said, adding that “demand for UAL flights are unlikely to be affected by this poor customer service incident.”, The incident comes two weeks after United drew social media scorn for enforcing its dress code for those who fly as nonrevenue passengers. A girl flying from Denver was told to change her leggings before boarding. In response, the airline then took efforts to tell “our regular customers” that “leggings are welcome.”, In its contract of carriage, United Continental Holdings Inc. says it chooses those to be bumped based on a fare class, an itinerary, status in its frequent flyer program, “and the time in which the passenger presents him/herself for check-in without advanced seat assignment.” That means those who paid more for a ticket and those who fly the airline frequently are less likely to be selected for an involuntary bump, criteria that are not unique to the Chicago-based carrier., Volunteers are paid for their seat and booked on another flight. But if there aren’t enough volunteers, an airline resorts to the involuntary method. And when it goes wrong, it can get very ugly. That’s one reason at least two U.S. airlines—JetBlue Airways Corp. and Virgin America—don’t do it., United required the seats on the Chicago plane to accommodate several crew members who needed to get to Louisville, to avoid cancelling other flights, spokesman Charles Hobart said Monday. The flight wasn’t, in fact, oversold. “It’s not something we want to do but occasionally it’s something we have to do,” Hobart said. “This was an instance where, unfortunately, we had to request the assistance of law enforcement because we had to get that aircraft off the ground.”, The U.S. Department of Transportation released a statement late Monday saying it’s reviewing the removal of the passenger “to determine whether the airline complied with the oversales rule.” The agency added that “it is legal for airlines to involuntary bump passengers from an oversold flight when there are not enough volunteers” and that “it is the airline’s responsibility to determine its own fair boarding priorities.”, Last year, the 12 largest U.S. airlines bumped slightly more than 40,600 of 659.7 million passengers, for a rate of 0.62 per 10,000 passengers, down from 0.73 per 10,000 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics., In 99 percent of cases, the benefits vastly outweigh the risks to the airline. The ultimate goal is to fill every seat on every flight, preferably in the order of who paid the most. Travelers flying on the lowest fares are those who also tend to volunteer their seats for compensation, while customers who pay the most—usually business travelers—can’t be tempted out of their seats. Overbooking pays off, too: Airlines almost always make more from the extra fares than they give back to volunteers in future-travel vouchers. When an airline can’t find enough volunteers—“involuntary denied boarding,” as regulators call it—the cost can run as high as $1,300 cash per passenger under revised rules adopted in 2011., Yet because airlines have amassed years of detailed data on passenger no-shows—down to days, times, seasons, and specific routes—they only rarely need to write customers fat checks. The data also help them know how to tweak their oversales for each flight, part of the complex algorithms that power revenue-management systems, the backbone of fare pricing. As a result, bumping has decreased over the past decade and is likely to dip further over time., Another factor weighs on the involuntary bumping issue: seat supply. Airlines that have rapidly dumped 50-seat jets in recent years aren’t adopting large mainline jets in response but turning to regional jets with 70-100 seats. The Embraer SA regional jet used on the April 9 flight to Louisville has 70 seats and is flown by Republic Airways Holdings Inc., The supply constraints have been great for boosting ticket yields but can prove detrimental when it comes to oversales. That’s one of the lessons United may be seeing in the aftermath of the dragged-passenger episode., But as for the man United removed, he probably has little legal recourse. This is because of the “broad discretion” airlines have under their carriage contracts, said Dan Lear, an attorney in Seattle. The carrier also could argue that a passenger who refuses instructions to exit has become belligerent and thus “a security risk” for the crew, he said., —With assistance from Alan Levin in Washington and Michael Sasso in Atlanta."

Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz even made another attempt at saying he was sorry., On Tuesday he offered his “deepest apologies for what happened” and said the airline would conduct a review of its procedures and policies to be completed by April 30., “No one should ever be mistreated this way,” he said in a statement, calling the event “truly horrific.”, Recordings of the incident posted on social media spread quickly around the globe and sent people into a rage. They showed officers pulling a passenger from a flight Sunday evening after he refused to give up his seat and then dragging him down the aisle as travelers yelled at them to stop., The chilling scene was turning into a public-relations disaster for United, whose fumbling response only served to demonstrate how a normally routine consumer interaction can expand into a brand-damaging event in a world of smartphones and Facebook. , The passenger, David Dao, was receiving treatment in a Chicago hospital for his injuries, according to a statement from lawyers at the firms Golan Christie Taglia and Corboy & Demetrio who said they represent him. His family “wants the world to know that they are very appreciative of the outpouring of prayers, concern and support,” the statement said., Munoz initially apologized for “having to re-accommodate these customers” but the CEO called the passenger “disruptive” and “belligerent” in a subsequent message to employees., “It was probably the most tone-deaf response I’ve seen to this type of issue -- possibly ever,” Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University, said on Bloomberg Television. “It’s as if they literally sat around and thought, ‘How could we make a bad situation worse.”’, QuickTake Quicktake: Airlines and the Law, United’s statements illustrate its “callousness toward the traveling public with the permission of the federal government,” New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said in a statement. He called for the U.S. Transportation Department to immediately suspend rules that allow carriers to overbook and remove passengers., United said initially that the flight was overbooked, its staff chose Dao among others and he didn’t want to get bumped. But the airline later said it needed room for its own employees to keep other flights on schedule., The stock fell 1.1 percent to close at $70.71 in New York, recovering from an intraday drop of 4.4 percent., United was the butt of jokes by late-night comedians and by Tuesday in China, the incident was even a focus of social media and a government editorial. The hashtag #UnitedForcesPassengerOffPlane was the top trending item on Sina Weibo, the equivalent of Twitter, with more than 270 million views by evening in China. The man who was removed appeared to be of Asian descent., Read more: Airline bumping and the law -- a QuickTake, China’s state mouthpiece the Global Times questioned in an editorial if “the victim’s Chinese ethnicity potentially made a difference” in how the passenger was treated. An online petition called “Chinese Lives Matter” calling for a U.S. investigation into the case has garnered 38,000 signatures., In an ironic touch, Munoz just last month was named “Communicator of the Year for 2017” by PRWeek. The public-relations industry publication said Munoz “has shown himself to be a smart, dedicated, and excellent leader who understands the value of communications.” , Munoz received support from flight attendants. His letter to United workers Monday night was only meant to boost employee morale in a very trying time, said Sara Nelson, international president of the flight-attendants union for United., “When something like this happens and people have to go to work and have order in their workplace to keep everyone safe, it can be incredibly demoralizing,” she said. “Some credit needs to be given to him.”, The incident showed how airline bumping can veer into confrontation. Carriers around the world routinely oversell their flights because people don’t always appear for a flight. Overselling is a way to cover that situation while maximizing the airline’s revenue., The swift social-media condemnation, which extended to Washington, was sparked because the man wasn’t being ejected for misbehavior or a security threat., Video posted to Facebook and Twitter showed the man being dragged out of his seat and down the aisle of Flight 3411 to Louisville, Kentucky, from Chicago. The man said he was a doctor and had to be in Louisville on Monday for work, according to a Twitter account by a passenger who said he was on the flight., United required the seats on the Chicago plane to accommodate several crew members who needed to get to Louisville to avoid canceling other flights, spokesman Charles Hobart said. The flight wasn’t oversold, he said., “It’s not something we want to do, but occasionally, it’s something we have to do,” Hobart said. “This was an instance where, unfortunately, we had to request the assistance of law enforcement because we had to get that aircraft off the ground.”, United’s response didn’t satisfy Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, who called the incident “disturbing” and Munoz’s statement an “empty apology.” Eleanor Holmes Norton, a nonvoting House Democrat representing the District of Columbia, called for Congressional hearings., The incident poses an incremental risk of inviting a response from lawmakers, Buckingham analyst Daniel McKenzie wrote in a note to investors. , “It’s a brand damaging event, but it’s unlikely investors will be able to pinpoint the fallout in UAL’s revenue production,” he wrote. Shareholders are more worried about competition and whether the carrier will miss revenue targets this summer as it increases seat availability, McKenzie said., But NYU’s Galloway said “heads should roll” at United because it will cost the airline both in terms of direct response by passengers and in damage to its image longer term. Potential travelers finding similar fares on United and a competitor may choose the rival because of the video, he said., “The airline industry is fairly competitive and often times you have more than one option at the same price,” he said. “At a minimum, this is a tie breaker. And in the airline industry, there are a lot of ties presented to consumers.”, The incident came two weeks after United drew social-media scorn for enforcing its dress code for people who fly as nonrevenue passengers, such as employees. A girl flying from Denver was told to change her leggings before boarding. In response, the airline then took efforts to tell “our regular customers” that “leggings are welcome.”, United’s contract of carriage says it chooses passengers to be bumped based on fare class, itinerary, status in its frequent-flier program, “and the time in which the passenger presents him/herself for check-in without advanced seat assignment.” That means those who pay more for a ticket and those who fly the airline frequently are less likely to be selected for an involuntary bump, criteria that aren’t unique to the Chicago-based carrier., A volunteer is paid for the seat and booked on another flight. But if there aren’t enough volunteers, an airline resorts to the involuntary method. When it goes wrong, it can get ugly. That’s one reason JetBlue Airways Corp., for example, doesn’t do it., Last year, the 12 largest U.S. airlines bumped slightly more than 40,600 of 659.7 million passengers, for a rate of 0.62 per 10,000 passengers, down from 0.73 per 10,000 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics."

Compensating everyone on a flight usually happens when a plane is delayed significantly on a tarmac, he said., It’s impossible to say how much reimbursing the 70 passengers on the Louisville, Kentucky-to-Chicago flight will cost until United offers details on the form of compensation. Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the carrier, declined to say if it would be in cash, frequent-flier miles or other forms., Delta Air Lines Inc. in November refunded passengers on a flight who were subjected to another passenger’s inflammatory comments aimed at women who supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton., Bruce Hicks, a public-relations consultant for carriers, said his former employer, Continental Airlines, once reimbursed all passengers for a flight that involved long delays and poor customer service. He speculated that Munoz may not have had all the facts when he made his comments the first couple of days., Otherwise, “he wouldn’t have stumbled so horribly,” Hicks said., The reimbursement and Munoz’s apology Wednesday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” in which the CEO came across as sincere, helped the airline’s cause, Hicks said. He said he doesn’t expect the fiasco will inflict long-term damage on United, partly because airline mergers have left little competition on some routes and since frequent-flier programs cement ties to travelers., Dao was treated in a Chicago hospital for his injuries, according to a statement from lawyers who said they represent him.

Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz has cleaned up messes left behind by others. Now he’s mopping up a PR disaster that’s unfolded on his watch., After United ordered a passenger forcibly removed from a plane in Chicago shortly before departure to make room for a United employee, Munoz’s initial response made the company a punch line on social media. He said United had to “re-accommodate’’ the man, who was bloodied in the encounter with security officials. In a subsequent letter to employees, the CEO called the customer “disruptive’’ and “belligerent’’ when he wouldn’t relinquish his seat. , “It’s sort of a self-immolation and makes you wonder about his choice as CEO,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. He “worked at Coke and Pepsi and AT&T, and someone would have thought he had a better customer sensitivity.”,  , Almost 24 hours later, after global condemnation of the airline’s behavior had time to sink in, Munoz struck a far more contrite tone., “The truly horrific event that occurred on this flight has elicited many responses from all of us: outrage, anger, disappointment,” Munoz said in a statement Tuesday. “I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way.”, Video posted to Facebook and Twitter showed the passenger as he was dragged out of his seat and down the aisle of the plane after refusing to give up his seat., On Wednesday Munoz said the carrier no longer will rely on law enforcement to remove seated, paying customers. “This can never, will never, happen again on a United Airlines flight,” he said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” The CEO said he hasn’t considered resigning., He has committed the third-largest U.S. airline to “a thorough review” of its policies for handling oversold flights and vowed to report back to the public by April 30., QuickTake Can Airlines Really Do That? Bumping and the Law, Yet the damage had already been done. With a few ill-chosen words, Munoz stoked the flames of an already raging social-media firestorm and squandered goodwill he had worked hard to generate by forging a turnaround plan since joining the company in September 2015. He has overseen a 23 percent stock rally since then, compared with 13 percent for the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index., Previously known for his deft touch in rescuing United from a corruption scandal, weathering a proxy fight and winning unprecedented labor peace, now he’s the head of an airline that, for some passengers, has instantly become Public Enemy No. 1., Read more: Airline bumping and the law -- a QuickTake, Some people said on United’s Facebook page that they would boycott the Chicago-based carrier. Others said on Twitter that they’d canceled their United-affiliated credit cards -- a key revenue source for airlines., In China, a crucial part of United’s lucrative trans-Pacific network, the incident was a focus of social media and editorials in the state-controlled Global Times newspaper. The hashtag #UnitedForcesPassengerOffPlane was the top trending item on Sina Weibo, the equivalent of Twitter. The man who was removed, David Dao, appeared to be of Asian descent., Delta Air Lines Inc. “is best-positioned to take share as it has focused Asia operations on China and away from Japan in recent years,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson said in a note. Gains will be limited for American Airlines Group Inc., a distant No. 3, while the largest Chinese carriers will benefit the most, he said., Several Middle Eastern carriers piled on to mock United, one of the principal critics of their rapid expansion. Dubai-based Emirates on Twitter lampooned United’s motto, urging passengers to “fly the friendly skies with a real airline.”, Dao was receiving treatment in a Chicago hospital for his injuries, according to a statement from lawyers who said they represent him. The lawyers sought a court order Wednesday in Chicago to preserve evidence, including surveillance videos, crew lists and other information, that could be used in litigation. A lawsuit hasn’t been filed., For Munoz, the timing of the worldwide outcry is, at the very least, extremely awkward and at worst a serious setback for his overhaul of United, which suffered for years as the industry laggard in profitability and on-time performance. Munoz just last month was named “Communicator of the Year for 2017” by PRWeek. The public-relations industry publication said Munoz “has shown himself to be a smart, dedicated, and excellent leader who understands the value of communications.”, In 2015, Munoz took over as CEO from Jeff Smisek, who was ousted amid a federal investigation into ties between the carrier and the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey. The next month, Munoz suffered a heart attack and underwent a transplant in early 2016. He bounced back only to face a proxy challenge from two hedge funds. United named a new chairman and agreed to add board members approved by PAR Capital Management and Altimeter Capital Management., Within months after the board tussle, Munoz had unveiled a $3.1 billion plan to cut costs and boost revenue, and he set the stage for labor peace for the first time since the 2010 merger with Continental Airlines that created the company. He also brought in new senior leadership including President Scott Kirby, who previously served in the same position at American. United’s market value this year surpassed that of American, which generates more in annual sales., The Dao incident comes two weeks after United drew social-media scorn for enforcing its employee dress code for those who fly as non-revenue passengers, such as relatives of employees. Two young girls flying from Denver were told to change their leggings before boarding. In response, the airline then took efforts to tell “our regular customers” that “leggings are welcome.”, In his letter to United workers Monday night, the CEO said he stood behind employees and criticized the passenger for refusing to deplane. Sara Nelson, international president of the flight attendants union representing United, said the event was the most severe customer backlash she’d seen in 20 years on the job and was “completely unacceptable.” Still, employees were grateful to have a chief executive who “has their backs.”, “When something like this happens and people have to go to work and have order in their workplace to keep everyone safe, it can be incredibly demoralizing,” Nelson said. “Some credit needs to be given to him.”"

While he didn’t name Airbus, Delta has no twin-aisle orders pending with Boeing, according to the U.S. company’s online database., “We continue to see excess capacity in wide-bodies as we look to the future for the industry,” Bastian said, adding that Delta, which has orders for the Airbus A350 and A330neo, is in discussions with planemakers. “We continue to look internally as to what that means for Delta. You could anticipate some reductions, I think, broadly over the next several years.”, Word of the review intensifies concerns that demand for long-haul planes is weakening as a long jet-buying binge draws to close. American Airlines Group Inc. last year deferred its A350 order, while United Continental Holdings Inc. said it may swap its A350 purchase for smaller planes., “It definitely contributes to what’s been a building caution, or wall of worry around the wide-body market,” said Ken Herbert, an aerospace analyst at Canaccord Genuity., Airbus shares traded 0.6 percent lower at 71.51 euros as of 9:29 a.m. Thursday in Paris. They closed 0.9 percent higher Wednesday after Bastian’s remarks, paring earlier gains of as much as 1.5 percent. Boeing closed down 1.4 percent to $176.05, the second-biggest slide among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average., Airbus confirmed that it is in touch with Delta, while declining to go into detail., “It’s not appropriate for us to comment on our customers’ internal analysis,” spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn said by email. “However, as a leading aircraft manufacturer, Airbus continually engages our customers around the world to help optimize their fleet needs.”, The Toulouse, France-based company out-dueled Boeing for Delta’s 50-jet order in 2014 and is slated to begin delivering the first of 25 A350s later this year. They’re intended to replace the Boeing 747 jumbos that once shuttled Delta’s passengers to Asia. The airline has also ordered 25 A330neos, a model that’s yet to fly, as a replacement for its oldest Boeing 767s., The prospect of Delta postponing or canceling the wide-body order adds to uncertainty over Airbus’s efforts to make inroads in the U.S. with its next-generation models., American last year delayed its A350 deliveries by an average 26 months and is due to take the first of 22 planes next year, spokesman Joshua Freed said. The planes were ordered by US Airways Group, which merged with American in 2013. United said last year it was reviewing its purchase of A350-1000s.  , Delta, too, could defer orders to a schedule that better fits its demand forecasts, or shift the mix to other models, according to aviation consultant Scott Hamilton. The carrier may issue a request for proposals for single-aisle aircraft that would pit Boeing’s 737 Max against Airbus’s A321neo and will also need a mid-market planes, such as the lighter-weight regional A330 or the so-called 797 under consideration at Boeing, he said by email., “At face value, the Delta statement might seem alarming,” Hamilton said. “But as so often becomes the case, the ‘review’ may not be what it seems.”, Sales of twin-aisle jets have slowed as the market absorbs a surplus after Boeing and Airbus boosted output at a 16 percent annual pace from 2011 through 2015, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. Late last year, Boeing announced a second cut to the production rate of its 777 jetliner amid a sales drought, while A330neo orders have stalled, he said., In December, Delta scrapped a longstanding order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners that it inherited in its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines. The airline said then that the decision was consistent with the need “to prudently address our wide-body aircraft needs.”"

The carrier also sees more favorable trends in ticket demand and is committed to keeping a lid on the supply of seats and flights to boost pricing, Raymond James Financial Inc. analyst Savanthi Syth said in a note Wednesday., The S&P Airlines Index advanced 1.9 percent at 10:37 a.m. in New York, including a 2.4 percent increase for Delta and a 2.3 percent gain for American Airlines Group Inc. United was little changed after declining Tuesday amid public fury that a passenger was dragged out of a plane by security officers after the carrier ordered his removal., Delta’s passenger revenue for each seat flown a mile fell 0.5 percent in the first quarter, behind the airline’s initial forecast from January that the measure, also known as unit revenue, would climb as much as 2 percent. The Atlanta-based carrier had expected a quicker recovery in sales of pricey, last-minute tickets favored by business travelers. Those fares are now “moving in the right direction,” President Glen Hauenstein said on a conference call with analysts., Investors have punished the shares, sending them down 7.9 percent this year through Tuesday compared with a 2.4 percent slide in Bloomberg index of U.S. airlines. The question now is whether Delta can finally hit its unit-revenue forecast “following several high-profile misses,” UBS Group AG analyst Darryl Genovesi said in a note., The underlying pricing and revenue environment looks solid, he said. Two years of fierce competition on some domestic routes has dented pricing power across the industry. A surge in seating capacity across the Pacific and Atlantic also has dragged down fares, with stepped-up competition on lucrative routes to Europe from discount airlines and some Middle Eastern carriers., The first quarter will probably be the worst of the year for Delta in terms of pressure on profit margins from higher fuel prices, said Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson., “With an improving revenue profile and further improvement as our cost growth moderates in the second half, we are on track to expand margins for the balance of the year,” he said in the statement., Earnings excluding certain items were 77 cents a share in the first quarter, the carrier said Wednesday, exceeding the average estimate of 75 cents a share based on the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell to $9.15 billion, compared with analysts’ prediction of $9.14 billion., About 4,000 flight cancellations following storms in Atlanta last week will reduce second-quarter pretax profit by $125 million, the company said. Pretax profit is expected to be $1.76 billion in the current quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg."

They showed officers pulling a passenger from a flight Sunday evening after he refused to give up his seat and then dragging him down the aisle as travelers yelled at them to stop., “There are a lot of no-shows,” Neeleman said at the New York Stock Exchange, shortly after Azul went public. Shares closed up 7.2 percent from their offering price in U.S. trading. “What would hurt the airlines big time is if someone in Congress saw this and wanted to basically make it against the law to overbook flights,"" Neeleman added., Neeleman’s concern isn’t far-fetched. United’s now widely public fiasco has prompted New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and a Democratic Senator from Connecticut to urge the U.S. Department of Transportation to take appropriate action against the practice of overbooking. ""The practice has become unconscionable by United and is abusing passengers coming through Newark Airport and around the nation without cause,"" Christie wrote in his letter addressed to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao., United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz on Tuesday offered his “deepest apologies for what happened” and said the airline would conduct a review of its procedures and policies to be completed by April 30., Neeleman suggested giving more power to staff at the gates to offer higher compensation to people who volunteer to give up their seats. JetBlue, which Neeleman is no longer a part of, doesn’t overbook passengers."

Pretax profit margin excluding one-time items also exceeded a previous forecast and the airline raised its planned growth in flights and seats., The results signaled progress for American in a two-year struggle by U.S. airlines to regain pricing power in the wake of a 2015 fare war. Delta Air Lines Inc. said earlier this month that unit revenue fell in the quarter as the price of last-minute tickets recovered more slowly than expected, and United Continental Holdings Inc. said Monday that the measure would be flat compared with a year ago., American rose 1.5 percent to $42.95 before the start of regular trading in New York., Pretax margin was 4 percent to 6 percent in the first quarter, up from a prior outlook for 3 percent to 5 percent. Costs for each seat flown a mile, a measure of efficiency, rose 8 percent in the quarter, below the carrier’s January forecast of a 9 percent rise., American said the supply of flights and seats would increase 1.5 percent this year, up from a prior plan for 1 percent capacity growth. The airline raised the number as it completes more flights and benefits from an increase in new pilots, which enables more flying by regional jets."

As of Sunday, she was still grounded. , Delta, which had canceled her original flight to Fort Lauderdale, rebooked her on another direct one for Sunday morning before canceling that one as well and offering her a multiple layover option instead., “They rebooked me on something today that has three legs,” the 24-year-old marketing professional said on Sunday. “It would take 12 hours of flying just to get to Florida from New York.” With her return flight scheduled only two days later, she decided to forgo the less-than-ideal rebooking and shelve her spring weekend getaway plans altogether., Days after a massive storm struck Atlanta, Delta Air Lines Inc. was still recovering from what airline insiders term an “irregular operation.” The nation’s second-largest carrier has canceled about 3,500 flights since Wednesday, more than the 2,300 canceled during a major computer failure in August that prompted Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian to apologize to passengers., Delta slid 0.5 percent to $44.96 at 10:11 a.m. in New York. Shares fell 8.2 percent this year through April 7, trailing the 5.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index. A spokesman for the airline declined to comment Sunday and couldn’t be reached Monday. , Fueling last week’s meltdown were Delta’s reliance on its Atlanta mega-hub and rules concerning how long flight crews can operate. While much was beyond Delta’s control -- including the surprisingly wicked storm that grounded all Atlanta flights for nearly five hours -- passengers, aviation experts and the airline’s own flight crews wonder if the carrier was slow to anticipate the storm’s severity and react quickly enough when communications started to break down., “I do not want to underestimate the chaos that a five-hour ground stop would cause,” said Bob Edwards, a former chief information officer at United Continental Holdings Inc. who recovered from several storms and computer outages during his tenure there. “Canceling quickly and getting ahead of it and staying ahead of it with cancellations is the key.”, Delta had canceled four flights by 9:34 a.m., compared with Sunday’s 167 cancellations, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. The carrier still had 102 delays Monday morning, the website said. Delta said it was “stabilizing” as of Sunday, but that rules mandating pilot and flight attendant rest were creating problems in finding people to fly and staff planes., “We know this is extremely frustrating for our customers and we apologize for that,” the airline said in a statement Sunday. “Delta teams continue to work around the clock to fully reset our operation and keep customers informed.”, Tales of passengers missing weddings and even pilots stuck in remote airports waiting for return trips to Atlanta were all over social media and present a challenge to an airline that prides itself on the best on-time arrival rate among its peers, according to Department of Transportation data. This is the third major cancellation event since summer, though the other two were caused by computer outages., Things were so backed up at Delta’s operations center that on Saturday the carrier urged pilots not to call in, and instead use an automated system called Roll Call for communicating with crew schedulers, an internal communication to pilots showed., Edwards, who left United in 2014, said the majority of Delta’s problems were almost certainly beyond the airline’s control. The Federal Aviation Administration called a ground stop for flights at Atlanta for at least 4 1/2 hours Wednesday, according to tweets from the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. A halt of an hour or two is more common, Edwards said. An outage of nearly five hours makes things “exponentially worse,” he said., That is long enough that many pilots and flight attendants no doubt ran up against federal regulations on how long they can work before resting. In recent years, things have become so strict that a pilot can be sitting in the cockpit awaiting takeoff and determine that he can’t reach his destination before timing out, Edwards said. He would have to disembark and the airline would have to find another pilot, he said., “There was probably a large number of pilots and crews that timed out, and they timed out in places where there probably were not replacements,” Edwards said., The trick is to get ahead of storms by proactively canceling flights, which prevents airlines from running afoul of flight crew rest rules and helps them reset their networks, he said. The question is whether Delta canceled enough flights at the outset to get ahead of things, he said. That’s especially vital in a hub as big as Atlanta, Edwards said. Sixty percent of Delta’s fleet goes through Atlanta on any given day, the carrier said last week., Delta Chief Operating Officer Gil West on Thursday noted Delta’s surprise at the storm’s severity., “Wednesday’s severe weather was unprecedented for Atlanta and the specific track and intensity of weather like this is often difficult to forecast,” he said in a statement., Another issue: the complex way that crews are paired up nowadays, said Michael Baiada, an aviation consultant and former pilot for United. Pilots, flight attendants and aircraft often come together for only a single flight -- say from Atlanta to New York -- before the pilot may head off on a flight to Chicago, the flight attendants go to Washington and the aircraft is sent to Dallas., That creates huge complexities, with pilots and flight attendants reaching their maximum hours at different times, Baiada said. He prefers the old system of pairing them all up into a team, he said., “It becomes much more complex because you’ve made all these pieces all over the map,” Baiada said., Wengel, the passenger from New York who missed her Florida vacation, said she’s been loyal to Delta because of its reliability in the past. She says she’s rethinking things now based on her experiences this week., “This will probably impact my view of Delta, but we’ll see what their response is as a result of this,” she said. “So far this has been handled so irresponsibly.”"
"77","Alaska Air Is Sticking With Virgin America’s Sexy Appeal","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-10/virgin-s-purple-lights-and-mood-music-win-alaska-s-love","17459","Alaska Airlines began in 1932 when Mac McGee, a former miner, truck driver, and dishwasher from the Midwest, decided to start a carrier in Anchorage. Since then, the airline has become a favorite for travelers in the Pacific Northwest, nurturing a following without such frills as mood lights or lounge music., That’s about to change., Alaska Air Group Inc. closed its $2.6 billion purchase of Virgin America in December. Unlike recent airline mergers born of financial duress, both Alaska and Virgin America had built successful franchises. Yet, they had fallen behind, dwarfed by rivals in an industry now dominated by behemoths. Alaska saw its growth inextricably tied to California, Virgin America’s base. A deal was struck. But merging staid Alaska with Virgin America, a brand that spearheaded the airline trend toward Austin Powers atmospherics, wasn’t going to be easy., Leading the effort is Ben Minicucci, who became Virgin America’s chief executive in December, adding to his roles as Alaska’s president and chief operating officer. Minicucci began flying weekly to San Francisco for the integration, with much of the job focused on trying “to get the culture right” in combining two very different companies., To that end, Alaska had all-day “momentum” sessions for about 3,500 Virgin America employees, in groups of 150, to explain the merger and the company’s plans. (The combined airline has more than 19,000 workers.) Seattle-based Alaska also saw the acquisition as an opportunity to freshen up its own, relatively aged brand., The airline expects to secure a single operating certificate from federal regulators in January 2018 and to convert to a single reservation system by the following fall. With those steps, Alaska will no longer operate Virgin America as a separate airline. In 2019, it plans to ditch the Virgin America brand entirely—a decision that drew public rebukes from Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, who described the move as an effort “to rip the heart out of the airline.”, Alaska is also mulling whether to mix things up when it comes to the jets it flies, retaining some Airbus Group SE A320-family aircraft that Virgin America uses to join Alaska’s uniform fleet of the Boeing 737s., A Montreal native, Minicucci, 50, is a Royal Canadian Air Force veteran who trained as a mechanical engineer. He began his civilian career at Air Canada before joining Alaska in 2004. He spoke by telephone from Seattle on April 5 to discuss how this unification of two very different brands is going., Q: What was the starting point for Virgin America employees?, They asked a ton of questions about Alaska, about the merger and what was going to happen. We wanted to honor what Virgin America built. They had a great culture. Alaska’s been around in business for 85 years, and we love our culture. But it’s an 85-year-old business. They were modern, they were hip, they were edgy. And we said, you know, we could probably bring some of that into the Alaska culture., We had all these traditional values from Alaska, we had the new values that were coming from Virgin, and we spent a lot of time saying, what should our purpose and values be for the new company? And it was actually Virgin’s purpose statement: “Creating an airline people love.” We just didn’t simply say, you’re just going to adopt the Alaska way. We honored Virgin America’s history and their values in saying, we’re going to infuse a little bit of red into blue and maybe, make it a little bit purple., Q: Was there any anger or disappointment?, A: There were two groups. There was a group that was totally happy that Alaska acquired Virgin America, just because we’ve had a history of stability, financial success, and they felt that their career now was in good hands. If you’re a pilot who’s worried about having a 20- or 30-year career—Virgin America had only had two successful financial years in nine., Some were sad to see the Virgin America brand go. People loved their brand, and it was special to them. What we needed to do in these “momentum” sessions is actually have them express that, to say, “We’re sad to see it go.” Then, throughout the eight hours in the session, bring up [Alaska] saying, “Yeah, we understand and we’re listening.” And then, at the end, inspire and motivate them about a future that could be better than what they had today: one that has more security, more growth, and more excitement., When they came in, you either had a frowny face, a neutral face, or a smiley face. And then at the end … we had them take the same survey and say how many frowny faces now are there—how many neutral faces and how many smiley faces compared to the start of the day? And inevitably, we’d see a massive increase by the end of the day., Q: You asked that actual “face” question?, A: Yeah, it was just saying, “Where are you?” We had clickers in the audience. So the clicker would be: one, if you’re a frowny face; two, if you’re a neutral face; and three, if you’re a smiley face. We’d see a 20-point increase in the categories by the end of the day., Q: Did you discuss why that company decided it had to be sold?, A: What we did was show Virgin America’s historical financials over the past nine years. One of the things we wanted to explain was that Alaska may not be a household name in California, but in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska is a powerful brand. It has a tremendous amount of loyalty, it generates a tremendous amount of goodwill in the communities, and it’s one of the reasons we’ve been so successful, at least in the last 10 years. , Q: You mentioned a little more purple. Will the new airline eventually look more like Virgin?, A: What I will say is the outside will look like Alaska. The inside, what you’ll see is brand elements of Virgin. If you fly Virgin, it’s unmistakable. You walk in, the purple lights, flying first class, the white seats, in-seat video, the whole thing with ordering from your seat. And that’s one of the things we loved about Virgin America; they were different, they were disruptive. So some of those things that made Virgin America unique that guests really loved, those were the things we said we need to bring to Alaska. And little things, like music at the gates or the ticket counter. That was different. Not a big thing, not an expensive thing, but just: The mood is different, right?, They were just ahead of their time. I had lunch with Fred Reid [Virgin’s founding CEO] and I asked him: “Where did you come up with the purple lights?” I wanted to understand where all of these innovative, disruptive ideas came from. They just wanted to be different. Where Virgin has really pushed Alaska’s thinking is how can we have a real great, innovative product that’s inspired by Virgin, but it’s Alaska., Q: Because of Virgin America’s focus on corporate traffic, do you need to be in “fortress hubs” like Atlanta, Dallas, JFK, Denver, or O’Hare more than you are now?, A: We’re going to build our West Coast network. We’re going to look at the top destinations where people want to go. What you want to do in our big hubs on the West Coast is provide utility; that’s how we’re wired. And then provide a great product at a low fare. We’re going to take our playback essentially from the Pacific Northwest and bring it into California., Q: Do you expect a lot more competitive fights with American, Delta, and United?, A: No. I think our experience in Seattle—we understand that anytime you’re in a hub, you’re going to have competition from other carriers. We’re going to be thoughtful and deliberate about how we grow our airline., Q: Will you paint the existing Virgin planes?, A: We are looking at perhaps in the fall of 2018, painting the Airbus airplanes—depending on the decisions we make here in the next few months., Q: At what point will you stop paying Virgin for the Virgin America brand?, A: I think we’re going to leave that for our legal folks to work out. Not much to say there., Q: Fair enough. Do you think there will be a lawsuit over this?, A: We hope not. We’ll just see how it plays out., Q: On the fleet, what attributes do you like or not like about the Airbus?, A: The 320 is a good airplane. But there’s always the right airplane for the right market, the right route. And what I will tell you is the 320, with the number of seats it has, its range capability—the [Boeing] 737-800 and -900 is a much more capable trans-continental airplane than the 320, based on seat density, based on range and payload. But the 320 is an excellent airplane. From a customer perspective, it’s a little wider; it’s about seven inches wider than a 737. We love single-fleet—it has massive, massive economics to stay single-fleet. But again, we’re going to stay open to the process and see where we land by the end of the year., Q: Is there anything the 320 can do that the Boeing can’t?, A: No, not really. They’re both very capable airplanes. I would just say the [Boeing] 37-800 and -900 just has more range and more payload than the [Airbus] 320. Now, the 321neo is different. We’re actually getting our first one here in two weeks. I’m actually going up to Hamburg to pick it up. The 321neo is going to be interesting, to see the capability of that airplane. It has addressed the range issues of its predecessor. The seat density is terrific. It’s got more range, more capability, so we’re very, very anxious to take a good look at the 321neo., Q: How do you plan to use that?, A: Of course, we’re going to use it trans-con. , Q: Not Hawaii?, A: It’s not ETOPS-certified [extended overwater operation for two-engine aircraft] yet. We’re hoping we can get it ETOPS-certified by the end of the year. And once we get it ETOPS certified, it would be a great airplane for Hawaii, actually., Q: If you like the Airbus 321neo, does that color the decision on the 320s?, A: No, I think there’s a process that we’re going to follow through. We’ll have a very analytical, economic process that will evaluate both fleets on many, many different criteria. And I think once we’ve done the analysis, I think the answer will emerge. There are so many factors, it’s hard to say whether you like it or not. You have to be careful of being subjective., Q: Bloomberg Intelligence speculated earlier this month that once your merger is complete, an Alaska-JetBlue deal would make sense for both airlines. What’s your view of that?, A: Right now, we’re focused on one thing: Getting this integration done. We can’t even think about doing something else right now. Doing an integration is a massive, massive amount of work. And our focus right now is getting this deal done, doing it well, getting the cultures right., Q: Of the prior industry mergers, which has been the most instructive for you among Delta, United, and American?, A: They were all interesting. They all had things that they did really, really well and some things that didn’t go well. I think I admire all three companies for doing those mergers. And I would say, in some respect, [they] were harder, because we acquired a 9-year-old airline and they were putting together airlines with decades and decades of history, which complicated their mergers. So I have a lot of respect for what they accomplished. We are actually a beneficiary of all the hard work that people put forth in all the other mergers."
"78","Rotten Tomatoes: Turkish Farmers Suffer Putin's Wrath Over Syria","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-11/rotten-tomatoes-turkish-farmers-suffer-putin-s-wrath-over-syria","17167","Along a fertile stretch of the northeastern Mediterranean, row after row of once-plump tomatoes are rotting on the vine., The fallout from the war in Syria is creeping further into Turkey, where the sanctions Vladimir Putin imposed after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s forces downed a Russian jet 16 months ago are pushing farmers toward ruin., “We cannot survive without the Russian market,” said Munir Sen, the head of the association of fruit and vegetable brokers in Mersin, the southern city that hosts Turkey’s biggest seaport. “Wastage rates have never been this high.”, Erdogan’s efforts at rapprochement with Putin have led to the lifting of the most punishing of the penalties, on Turkey’s key tourism industry. But with the two leaders pursuing conflicting agendas in Syria, Putin is refusing to budge on the tomato ban, keeping a lid on a market that had accounted for 70 percent of all Turkish exports of the fruit. While some shipments are being redirected, the Russian hole, worth a quarter of a billion dollars a year, is just too big to fill., Putin’s squeeze is adding to a surge in unemployment and a widening trade deficit, turning the plight of tomato growers and sellers into a campaign issue for Erdogan, who’s asking voters to grant him vast new powers in an April 16 referendum. Turkey is hitting back by effectively barring purchases of wheat from Russia, the world’s largest supplier. That’s a retaliation fraught with risks for a country that’s the world’s biggest flour exporter and one of the biggest per capita consumers of bread., The tit-for-tat escalation is “unsustainable,” Turkish Agriculture Minister Faruk Celik said in an interview on March 29 in Istanbul, imploring Russia to negotiate a truce and avoid hurting producers and consumers in both countries., “We need each other,"" Celik said., But Turkey’s struggling farmers are being held hostage to an even bigger and vastly more damaging dispute -- the multinational proxy war in Syria., While Putin has enlisted Erdogan’s backing for efforts to end the six-year conflict, which Russia joined in November 2015, the leaders remain deeply at odds over Turkey’s policy of pushing for the removal of Putin’s Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, and Moscow’s embrace of Kurdish forces Ankara considers terrorists., Keeping some agricultural bans serves two purposes for Putin, according to Alexander Shumilin, head of the Middle East Conflicts Center in Moscow. It allows Russia to retain leverage over Erdogan while also helping the domestic businesses investing in food production to aid a Kremlin push for self-sufficiency., The food feud began with great fanfare in Russia in January 2016, when state TV broadcast the ceremonial bulldozing of Turkish tomato stocks. With regulators in Moscow urging Russia to keep the ban for several years, investors including billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov started to move into the industry., “The argument here is that once the ban was enacted, significant investments were made in domestic tomato production, and in order to protect these investors, the ban should remain,"" said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of political analysis company Teneo Intelligence in London. “My personal intuition is that the real reason is that Russia will continue to exert leverage over Turkey for political reasons."", On March 10, Erdogan expressed confidence on his way to Moscow that he’d be able to persuade Putin to lift all remaining sanctions. He returned almost empty-handed, with Russia removing only restrictions on a few vegetables that collectively had just a fraction of the sales tomatoes did., “Russia raised restrictions on some products that totaled $19 million,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in an interview in Antalya on April 6. “That’s the value of what’s exported by one little company."", Apparently stung by the rebuke, Erdogan moved to retaliate four days later, when the Turkish-backed opposition in Syria suddenly pulled out of multiparty peace talks that Russia had organized in Kazakhstan. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, visibly angered, demanded an explanation from Ankara., The backlash intensified with the decision in Turkey to strike Russia from the “permitted origins” list that grain brokers use to avoid punitive import duties. The prospect of being shut out of a key market set off alarm bells in Moscow. It also helped trigger the first decline in wheat prices for Black Sea loading since the end of last year., Russia could sell most of the wheat that Turkey’s not taking to countries in Africa, according to a report by Kiev-based consultant UkrAgroConsult. But Russia has already been struggling to sell a record crop amid global oversupply, prompting forecasts that it could lose its title as the world’s largest exporter as soon as this year., And its consumers are missing out., “This food ban needs to go,"" said Anastassia Paloni, a 31-year-old translator in Moscow. “We have like no vegetables here in the winter, it’s ridiculous."", For its part, Turkey has increased imports of Baltic grain to fill the Russian gap, and booked shipments from places including Ukraine and Hungary, according to S&P Global Platts. But it’ll struggle to find the high-protein wheat it needs to re-export as flour, Volodymyr Slavinskyy, a trader at grain trading company Nibulon, said in an interview in Kiev on April 5., “I don’t expect Turkish buyers to change their preferences, because they are buying this wheat not to cover some internal demand in Turkey, but to produce flour and export it,"" Slavinskyy said. “Quality still is an issue in this case."", Nonetheless, Turkey is taking a tough stance. On March 21, Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci threatened to “cut to zero” $1.83 billion of annual Russian food sales to Turkey if all bans aren’t lifted., His warning came a day after Syrian Kurdish fighters released a statement saying Russia had agreed to train them. Russia didn’t deny the claim, saying only that it has an army unit in Kurdish-held northwestern Syria to monitor a cease-fire., “You can only push Erdogan so far,” said Alexei Malashenko, a Middle East expert at the Moscow Carnegie Center. “Pressure on Turkey can boomerang.”, The standoff shows no sign of easing, as Erdogan and Putin continue to back opposing sides in the Syrian war. After U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a strike on Syria last week in response to a chemical weapons attack blamed on Assad’s regime, Russia called the intervention a dangerous violation of international law. Turkey applauded the strike, and offered the U.S. any support it needed in Syria., On Monday, Russia warned airlines that it could reimpose a ban on charter flights to Turkey, according to the nation’s Tourist Industry Union. The earlier travel ban imposed in 2015 devastated parts of Turkey’s tourism industry, with just 866,000 Russians visiting last year, down from 4.5 million in 2014., Both Erdogan and Putin seem locked into positions they consider vital to national security, leaving no relief in sight for Turkey’s beleaguered tomato industry., “Producers were really hopeful about this year, that ties with Russia would improve,” Sen, the broker in Mersin, said by phone. “Instead, here we are.”"

The seat is scheduled to be available to customers by early 2019., “It’s not a secret that there have been challenges in the seat industry,” Beth Anderson, Boeing’s vice president for payloads and systems, supplier management, said in an interview at the German trade fair. “It’s not just Zodiac. There isn’t enough capacity.”, Boeing’s expansion into helping to supply what’s usually regarded as “buyer-furnished equipment” -- chosen directly by airlines -- is a further sign that it’s intent on taking whatever steps are necessary to avoid production delays. Planemakers and suppliers are coming under pressure as they seek to boost output to record levels after running up order backlogs that stretch for years., Holdups at Plaisir, France-based-Zodiac have already delayed handovers of Boeing 777-300s to United Airlines, while issues with seats and lavatory blocks stymied production of Airbus Group SE’s A350 model., The 737 seat from Encore’s Huntington Beach, California-based LIFT unit found its first customer three months after the Boeing partnership was announced in April 2016, with the initial delivery scheduled for October this year, Anderson said, without disclosing the airline’s name. Such a timescale represents a “really accelerated schedule,” she added., “It’s a different concept, where we take an airplane and design a seat,” the executive said. “We’d be contracting with LIFT for the seat, so you get the benefit of the Boeing-supplied piece of equipment, but the airline can still negotiate the pricing directly.”, Airbus said separately that it will establish a new unit to support airlines in their cabin-development plans. The Airbus Interiors Services business will draw on the expertise of the company’s corporate-jet arm and focus on bespoke products, aircraft upgrades and innovations such as a ceiling stowage area devised for the A320 jet, according to an announcement at the Hamburg show."
"80","Laptop Ban Raises Warning of Fire Risk on Planes","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-07/laptop-ban-spurred-by-terror-concern-raises-warning-of-fire-risk","17367","The U.S. order prohibiting passengers from carrying laptop computers and other electronics into the cabins of some overseas flights is raising concerns about a risk unrelated to terror: the potential for those devices’ lithium-based batteries to catch fire in the baggage hold., The Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit funded by airlines and other groups to reduce the risk of accidents, on Friday issued a press release urging the industry to take steps not to “introduce another risk” from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics., The concern is that passengers are being told to place electronic devices into cargo holds just as international safety agencies have begun barring bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium cells because of evidence that they can spontaneously catch fire and even explode., “It’s potentially a transfer of consequential risk,” Greg Marshall, vice president of Global Programs at the safety group, said in an interview. “We’re going to see large numbers of these devices carried in the cargo hold of aircraft that would otherwise have been in the cabin.”, The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration logged 31 cases last year in which lithium-based batteries either caught fire or smoldered on airline flights. Three cargo aircraft have been destroyed by fires attributed at least in part to lithium batteries, two of which were fatal accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board., Read more: Airplane Fire Risk Prompts Widening Ban on Smartphone Batteries, “We coordinated closely with the FAA and provided an information bulletin to the air carriers regarding the appropriate handling of electronics, including lithium batteries,” Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Jenny Burke said in an emailed response to the safety group’s warning., On March 21, the U.S. notified airlines that it wouldn’t permit passengers on flights headed to the U.S. from 10 Middle Eastern airports -- including Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Cairo -- to carry any electronic device larger than a smartphone. DHS said the action was the result of new intelligence that terrorists were planning to target airlines by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.”, The U.K. followed with a similar ban the same day. Representative John Katko, a New York Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Security Subcommittee, said March 29 that the threat was real, and predicted other nations would broaden the ban. DHS Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told Congress the action may be extended to other airports., However, the fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety: the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires., The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization last year concluded that lithium-ion cells were too risky to be carried in bulk on passenger flights after manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE advised airlines that existing fire suppression systems weren’t adequate to protect planes against lithium fires., While the terrorist threats may be real, the government should perform a risk analysis and take steps to reduce the potential for battery fires, said John Cox, a safety consultant who has written on the subject of aircraft fires., Some carriers have allowed passengers to keep their laptops and tablet computers with them until just before departure, before gathering them in a bin to be stowed in the cargo hold, Cox said. Placing the devices in such close proximity to each other increases the potential risks if one catches fire, he said., “If they are in the cargo hold and one overheats and goes into thermal runaway, you can’t deal with it,” he said., Pilots and flight attendants are trained to extinguish a battery fire in the cabin, but wouldn’t be able to reach a blaze in a cargo area, he said., Passengers should be reminded to switch off electronics if they pack them in checked bags, the Flight Safety Foundation’s Marshall said. They also shouldn’t assume it’s now permissible to stow spare batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage bound for the cargo hold. Those items are still prohibited in checked bags, he said."
